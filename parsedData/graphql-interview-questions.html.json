Even if the object model contains a lot of fields, the client can request only the required fields. ","result":"GraphQL is designed to optimize the amount of data that is fetched by the client. Instead of retrieving the entire object model, it allows the client to request only the necessary fields. This means that even if the model contains a large number of fields, only the required data is retrieved."},{"tag":"p","original":" No. GraphQL is not a Database Technology. People confuse GraphQL being a database technology, but this is not true. GraphQL is data query and manipulation language for APIs - not databases. It is also a server-side runtime for executing queries when you define a type system for your data. Unlike the REST APIs, a GraphQL server provides only a single endpoint and responds with the precise data that a client asked for. ","result":"While some people mistakenly believe that GraphQL is a database technology, this is not true. GraphQL is actually a data query and manipulation language for APIs. It's designed to be used on the server-side, where it functions as a runtime for executing queries that have been defined using a type system. Unlike REST APIs, GraphQL only provides a single endpoint, and it responds with exactly the data that the client requested."},{"tag":"p","original":" You can say that GraphQL is database agnostic, and it can be used with any database. It can also be used without any database. ","result":"GraphQL is a data retrieval and manipulation language that can be utilized with any database or without a database. It is not dependent on a specific database and can be made compatible with any kind."},{"tag":"p","original":" No. It is not right to say that GraphQL is only for React or JavaScript Developers.

Yes, we already had an API called REST for data communication, which follows a clear and well-structured resource-oriented approach. It also provides some great ideas such as stateless servers, structured access to resources, etc. But, REST is not so flexible to cope up with the rapidly changing requirements of the clients. In that case, when the data gets more complex, the routes get longer. Sometimes, it is challenging to fetch the data with a single request. That's why Facebook takes a step to develop a new API technology named GraphQL to cope up with the REST's limitations. ","result":"Many people wonder why GraphQL, a new API technology, was created when we already had REST for data communication. Although REST is a well-structured and resource-oriented approach, it's less flexible and struggles to meet clients' ever-changing requirements. When data complexity increases, the routes get longer and single-request data fetching becomes difficult. In response to these limitations, Facebook developed GraphQL to offer a better solution to API users."},{"tag":"p","original":"  The GraphQL API is usually operated over  HTTP , and it is a transport layer agnostic technology, so you can choose protocols other than  HTTP  to implement your server.  ","result":"The GraphQL API typically utilizes HTTP as its mode of operation but is adaptable to other communication protocols as well. This allows for flexibility in server implementation."},{"tag":"p","original":" Authentication and AuthorizationAuthorization are the processes used in services. Sometimes people get confused in these two terms and exchange their definitions for each other. ","result":"Authentication and Authorization are important processes utilized in various services. It is common for individuals to mistakenly interchange the meanings of these terms."},{"tag":"p","original":"  Authentication:  Authentication is a process that is used to claim an identity. Authentication is done when you want to log in to a service with a username and password. Here, you have to authenticate yourself. In GraphQL, Authentication can be implemented with common patterns such as OAuth. OAuth is an open protocol that is used to allow secure AuthorizationAuthorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile, and desktop applications. ","result":"Authentication is the process of proving your identity when logging into a service. This can be accomplished through various means, such as entering a username and password.

For authorization implementation in GraphQL, it is recommended to delegate any data access logic to the business logic layer and not handle it directly. ","result":"Authorization refers to the process of granting permission rules to users and user groups, determining their access rights to various parts of the system. In GraphQL, it's best practice to delegate data access logic to the business logic layer and not handle it directly. This ensures a secure implementation of authorization."},{"tag":"p","original":"  It is easy to see the error in GraphQL. A successful GraphQL query is supposed to return a  JSON  object with a root field called \"data.\" If your request query fails or partially fails, you will see a second root field called \"errors\" in the response. See the below example ","result":"The mistake in GraphQL can be identified by checking the response JSON object, which should include a \"data\" field for successful queries and an additional \"errors\" field for queries that fail or only partially succeed. Here is an example:"},{"tag":"p","original":" The biggest concern with GraphQL technology is that it is difficult to maintain the server-side cache compared to the REST. In REST API, we can easily cache data for each endpoint. This is because the structure of the data does not change. On the other hand, in GraphQL API, it's not clear what the client will request next, so it does not matter to put a caching layer right behind the API. That's why doing Server-side Caching difficult in GraphQL. ","result":"One major issue with GraphQL technology is the fact that it can be challenging to maintain the server-side cache compared to REST. In REST API, data can be cached for every endpoint because the structure remains constant. However, with GraphQL API, it's unclear what the client will request next, so it's difficult to implement a caching layer immediately behind the API. As a result, achieving server-side caching with GraphQL can be quite complicated."},{"tag":"p","original":" In GraphQL, when a client requests a query, the server returns the JSON format response. The response returned by the server is based on the query the client uses for the request. ","result":"When a GraphQL query is sent by a client to a server, the server responds with a JSON format result that corresponds to the requested query. The information returned by the server is dependent on the specific query that the client sends."},{"tag":"p","original":" Over-fetching is a response where the client gets too much data or extra data for an API request. In over-fetching, you have a lot of additional data in the response you don't use. Over-fetching unnecessarily increases the payload size. ","result":"Over-fetching occurs when an API request returns more data than is required by the client. This leads to the client receiving excess or irrelevant data. Over-fetching results in an increased payload size and can impact the overall performance of API requests."},{"tag":"p","original":" Under-fetching is a response where the client doesn't get enough data. The under-fetching response doesn't have enough data with a call to an endpoint, so you have to call a second endpoint to fulfill your request or multiple API calls to fetch the complete data.  ","result":"Under-fetching is an issue that occurs when clients are unable to receive sufficient data in response to a single API call made. This often requires the client to make additional API calls or queries to obtain all the necessary data. This situation arises due to the limitation of data transfer protocol and API design, leading to insufficient data retrieval with a single endpoint call."},{"tag":"p","original":" Over-Fetching and Under-fetching both are the performance issues that can be solved by using GraphQL. You won't see these problems if you have precisely the right endpoints to give your products exactly the correct data. These problems occur when you have to maintain multiple endpoints to get the exact right data. It has increased the data load, which finally results in a performance issue. ","result":"GraphQL is a solution to performance issues such as Over-fetching and Under-fetching. These problems arise when multiple endpoints are involved in order to obtain the exact data required for products. This leads to an increase in data load, negatively impacting performance. However, if endpoints are precisely defined, these issues can be avoided."},{"tag":"p","original":" GraphQL resolves this issue because it facilitates you to request the specific data which you want from the server. Here, you can specify what you need in a single request and get the exact result that you need in just one response from the server. ","result":"GraphQL is a solution to the problem where traditional RESTful APIs might return too much data or not enough data for a certain request. With GraphQL, you are able to request only the data that you need from the server. By specifying what you need in a single request, you can get exactly the result that you want in a single response without having to make multiple requests to the server."},{"tag":"p","original":" A list of the most significant advantages of using GraphQL over REST: ","result":"Here are some important benefits of utilizing GraphQL as opposed to REST:"},{"tag":"li","original":" There is only one endpoint in GraphQL, but REST has multiple endpoints. That's why GraphQL is more cost-effective than REST. You don't have to use your resources for various endpoints. ","result":"In comparison to REST, GraphQL has only one endpoint while REST has multiple endpoints. This makes GraphQL a more cost-effective option as it allows you to save your resources which would otherwise be used for numerous endpoints in REST."},{"tag":"li","original":" In REST API, you have to use multiple requests to retrieve a complex data-set, but in GraphQL, you can execute a complex query easily in just a single request.
