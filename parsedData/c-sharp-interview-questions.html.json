These methods only have declaration not the definition. These abstract methods must be implemented in the inherited classes.  ","result":"The class Interface is an abstract class that consists of only abstract methods which are declared, but not defined. These methods are required to be implemented in the classes that inherit from Interface."},{"tag":"p","original":" Lock statement is used to ensure that one thread doesn?t enter a critical section of code while another thread is in the critical section. If another thread attempts to enter a locked code it will wait, block, until the object is released.  ","result":"The lock statement is a mechanism that prevents multiple threads from entering a critical section of code simultaneously. This ensures that one thread completes the critical section before another thread enters it. When a thread encounters a lock statement, it will wait until the critical section is released before proceeding. This prevents any issues that could arise from multiple threads accessing the same resources at the same time."},{"tag":"p","original":" If you want to transport an object through network then you have to convert the object into a stream of bytes. The process of converting an object into a stream of bytes is called serialization.  ","result":"To transmit an object over a network, it must be transformed into a series of bytes. This conversion process is known as serialization."},{"tag":"p","original":" Early binding and late binding are the concept of polymorphism. There are two types of polymorphism in C#.
