The main reason behind choosing this statement is that cash is king, and the cash flow gives a true picture of how much cash the company is generating. It is a behavioral question, so you can probably pick a different answer for this question, but you have to provide a good justification. For example, you can choose the balance sheet and say that assets are the true driver of cash flow. You can even choose an income statement and say that it shows the company's earning power and profitability.  ","result":"If we had to choose only one statement to assess a company's overall health, it would be advisable to use the cash flow statement. This is because cash flow is crucial to an organization's financial stability, and the statement presents an accurate picture of how much cash the business generates. While this is a subjective question, an appropriate response would be one that provides a strong justification. One might argue, for example, that the balance sheet is the preferable choice because assets are the primary drivers of cash flow. Another option might be to select the income statement as it demonstrates the company's earning power and profitability."},{"tag":"p","original":" This is a subjective question which you can answer in your way. A good budget is a realistic budget that can strive for achievement, has been risk-adjusted to allow for a margin of error, and is tied to the company's overall strategic plan. To get this budget, we need an iterative process that includes all departments. It can be zero-based or building off the previous year, but it depends on what type of business you're running and which approach is better. It's important to have a good budgeting/planning calendar that everyone can follow.  ","result":"A suitable budget for a business is one that is feasible, tailored to success, and encompasses contingency planning. It must be closely aligned with the company's overall strategic objectives and involve input from all departments through an iterative process.

A well-structured budgeting and planning timetable that is easily followed by everyone is crucial for success."},{"tag":"p","original":" WACC is an acronym that stands for Weighted Average Cost of Capital.
