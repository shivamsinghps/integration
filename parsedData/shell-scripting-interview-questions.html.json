Unlike the for loop, the while loop does not have a predetermined number of iterations and will continue running as long as its condition remains true."},{"tag":"p","original":"  Inode:  Each file contains an index number known as \"inode\" which is comprised of metadata about the associated file. ","result":"An inode is present in every file and serves as an index number that stores crucial metadata about the file."},{"tag":"p","original":"  Hard Link:  is the mirror of original linked file. In such case, hard link and original file contains same inode. Hard link remains linked whether original file is removed. ","result":"A hard link is a type of link that mirrors the original linked file, sharing the same inode number. Even if the original file is removed, the hard link remains linked."},{"tag":"p","original":"  Soft Link:  is like shortcut feature of Windows OS. In such case, hard link and original file contains different inode. Soft link will not work correctly if original file is removed. ","result":"A soft link is similar to a shortcut feature found in Windows OS, where the original file and hard link have different inodes. However, if the original file is removed, the soft link will not function properly."},{"tag":"p","original":" The $# shows total number of arguments passed to the script.
