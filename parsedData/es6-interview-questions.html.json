Based on the asynchronous operation, it returns either the first argument or the second argument. ","result":"After a Promise is either fulfilled or rejected, it will not be able to change. The Promise() constructor requires two arguments: a rejected function and a resolved function. The function that is returned depends on the result of the asynchronous operation and will be either the rejected or resolved function."},{"tag":"p","original":"  Callback:  It is used to handle the execution of function after the completion of the execution of another function. A callback would be helpful in working with events. In the callback, a function can be passed as an argument to another function. It is a great way when we are dealing with basic cases such as minimal asynchronous operations. ","result":"A callback function is utilized to manage the execution of a function after the conclusion of another function's execution. It is especially useful when working with event-driven programming. By passing a function as an argument to another function as a callback, it allows for a more efficient way of handling basic asynchronous operations."},{"tag":"p","original":"  Callback hell:  When we develop a web application that includes a lot of code, then working with callback is messy.
