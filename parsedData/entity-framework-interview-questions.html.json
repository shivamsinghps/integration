This can occur because these fields may allow SQL statements to be passed through, which can directly query the database. One area where SQL injection can be a concern is with ADO.NET data service queries. However, the Entity Framework is considered to be secure against SQL injection because it creates parameterized SQL commands each time data is accessed. It's important for developers to avoid combining user input with Entity SQL command text in order to add an extra layer of security."},{"tag":"p","original":" In Entity Framework, the navigation property is used to represent a foreign key relationship in the database.
