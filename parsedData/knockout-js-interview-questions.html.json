[{"tag":"p","original":" Most asked Knockout JS Interview Questions ","result":"Sure! Here's the rephrased content: \n\nFrequently asked questions during a Knockout JS interview."},{"tag":"p","original":" Knockout JS is a JavaScript library based on the MVVM (Model View View Model) pattern that helps developers building rich and responsive websites. It is a small, lightweight JavaScript library that is mostly used to design and develop a SPA (Single Page Application). It assists rapid development in the browser, especially where ViewModels and arrays are involved.  ","result":"Knockout JS is a popular JavaScript library that facilitates the creation of rich and responsive websites using the MVVM (Model View View Model) pattern. It's a lightweight library that's commonly incorporated into Single Page Applications (SPAs). Knockout JS is especially useful when it comes to rapid development in the browser, particularly when ViewModel and array handling is required."},{"tag":"p","original":" Knockout Js is a lightweight framework that can dramatically reduce the amount of code needed to synchronize a data model and user interface controls. It is extremely fast, cross-browser compatible, and not reliant on any other libraries. ","result":"Knockout Js is a software framework that facilitates the synchronization of data models and user interface controls in a streamlined manner. It's a lightweight solution that is highly performant, compatible with multiple web browsers, and doesn't require any external libraries to function."},{"tag":"p","original":" Its lightweight feature (It is &lt; 20kb after compression) can be easily integrated with most web applications without any major architectural update. That's why it is getting popular day by day. ","result":"The small size of its code, weighing less than 20kb after being compressed, makes it convenient for integration with numerous web applications. This attribute has contributed to the increase in its popularity."},{"tag":"p","original":"  Most prominent features of Knockout JS are:   ","result":"Knockout JS has several notable characteristics, including..."},{"tag":"li","original":" Support all modern browsers ","result":"Ensure compatibility with all up-to-date web browsers."},{"tag":"li","original":" Compact Size less than 20 kb. ","result":"The size of the file is smaller than 20 kilobytes, making it compact in nature."},{"tag":"li","original":" Written in Pure JavaScript ","result":"The code was created using only native JavaScript."},{"tag":"p","original":" Knockout JS supports two types of data binding: ","result":"There are two forms of data binding that can be utilized in Knockout JS."},{"tag":"p","original":" Knockout JS deploys the two-way data binding. It uses the \"data-*\" tags to create a live dynamic link between a browser UI control and a member or method inside a data ViewModel. Let's understand it by a demo example: Suppose you have a data model with a field 'FirstName' and an edit box linked using the data-bind attribute to 'FirstName,' then anytime the data model changes (for example, programmatically), that change immediately shows in the edit box, and any time a user makes a change to the FirstName in the edit box, the underlying data in the field 'FirstName' is changed.  ","result":"Knockout JS is a framework that takes advantage of two-way data binding to facilitate communication between a web page's UI elements and a data ViewModel. This is accomplished by using \"data-*\" tags to create a live connection between the two. For example, if a user changes the value of a field such as \"FirstName\" in an edit box linked to the ViewModel, the underlying data will be updated automatically. Conversely, if the data model is changed elsewhere in the program, this change will also be reflected in the UI in real-time."},{"tag":"p","original":" The dependency tracking is a feature in Knockout JS that facilitates Knockout JS to update the UI (DOM) automatically when your data model is changed. ","result":"Dependency tracking is a useful feature of Knockout JS that allows for automatic updates of the user interface, or DOM, when changes are made to the data model. This functionality makes it easier for developers to manage their applications, ensuring that user inputs and other operations are accurately reflected in the UI without requiring manual updates."},{"tag":"p","original":" Knockout JS is quick and easy to learn. It is not as complete as Angular and doesn't have anywhere near the functionalities of Angular, but it provides a powerful mechanism for working with data and vastly reduces the amount of code needed to implement a robust modern, client-side solution. The best feature of Knockout JS is that it provides highly efficient data-binding, and it does it well. That's why it is gaining popularity day by day.  ","result":"Knockout JS is a user-friendly and fast framework for client-side web development. Although it might not be as feature-rich as Angular, it offers an efficient way of working with data and allows developers to write less code when creating complex applications. What makes Knockout JS stand out is its impressive data-binding capabilities, which provide optimal performance. As a result, Knockout JS has become increasingly popular."},{"tag":"p","original":" In Knockout JS, observables are a special type of JavaScript objects used to notify subscribers about changes and automatically detect dependencies. Observables help Knockout JS to update your UI automatically when the view model changes. ","result":"Knockout JS utilizes observables as a unique type of JavaScript objects which are designed to inform subscribers of modifications and identify relationships automatically. The purpose of using observables in Knockout JS is to ensure that changes made to the view model are reflected in the UI without requiring manual update."},{"tag":"strong","original":" This is how an observable is created in Knockout JS: ","result":"One way to create an observable in Knockout JS is to follow a specific process within the framework."},{"tag":"p","original":" The computed observable in Knockout JS is a special type of function that depends on one or more observables to work. For example, when the value of one or more linked observable is changed, the computed observable gets called. The classic example of a computed observable is 'Full Name,' which observes and combines 'first name' and 'last name' to make 'Full name.' ","result":"A computed observable is a unique function in Knockout JS that relies on one or more observables for its functionality. When any of the associated observables is modified, the computed observable is triggered. One popular use case for computed observables is creating a Full Name function that relies on the values of the First Name and Last Name observables."},{"tag":"p","original":" The Knockout JS ViewModel looks similar to a basic class created in JavaScript as a function. It is declared as a variable and can have members and methods.  ","result":"The ViewModel in Knockout JS is defined as a variable and has similarities with a JavaScript class. It functions as a container for members and methods and can be customized to suit the needs of the application."},{"tag":"p","original":" We can easily activate a Knockout JS model by calling the key method 'ko.applyBindings' and passing in the model's name to bind to as a parameter. For example: ","result":"To activate a Knockout JS model, we need to use the 'ko.applyBindings' method and input the model's name as a parameter to bind it."},{"tag":"p","original":" Yes. We can bind Knockout JS to multiple models at one time easily. We have to keep the different models isolated to put any mark-up in separate div containers, named with a unique ID, and call the key 'applyBindings' method for each model, passing in the ViewModel as the first parameter, and the matching div ID as the second parameter. ","result":"Certainly! It is possible to bind Knockout JS to multiple models simultaneously, requiring only that each model be kept isolated in its own div container with a unique ID. To apply the bindings, call the 'applyBindings' method for each model, passing in the ViewModel as the first parameter and the corresponding div ID as the second parameter."},{"tag":"p","original":" The Observable arrays are the set of knockout properties that contain all the things gathered in the view model. This property is bind with UI (View) in two-way binding.  ","result":"Observable arrays are an integral part of the Knockout framework's view model. They store all the data that is connected to the user interface and facilitate two-way binding between the view and the model."},{"tag":"p","original":" The Knockout JS is used in context properties in the following ways: ","result":"Knockout JS is utilized for defining contextual properties in various manners such as:"},{"tag":"p","original":" The Knockout JS does not depend on the jQuery library, but we can use jQuery simultaneously. Using Knockout JS, we can handle client and server-side applications simultaneously in an easy way.  ","result":"Knockout JS is an independent library that does not require jQuery, although it can be used alongside it. Additionally, with Knockout JS, managing client-side and server-side applications is simplified."},{"tag":"p","original":" The following table specifies the differences between the Knockout JS and MVC:  ","result":"The table below outlines the disparities between Knockout JS and MVC."},{"tag":"td","original":" Knockout JS is an MVVM (Model View View Model) pattern. ","result":"Knockout JS is a programming framework that follows the MVVM (Model View View Model) pattern."},{"tag":"td","original":" MVC is a design pattern. ","result":"The concept of MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a methodology used in software engineering for the development of user interfaces. It is a design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller."},{"tag":"td","original":" Knockout JS works like a connected mode. ","result":"Knockout JS operates in a connected mode where its components are linked together and any changes made to one component will immediately reflect in the others."},{"tag":"td","original":" MVC works in disconnected mode. ","result":"MVC operates in a state where it is not connected to any particular server or database."},{"tag":"td","original":" MVC supports only one-way binding. ","result":"The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture supports single-direction binding only."},{"tag":"td","original":" In Knockout JS, the UI part is automatically updated when you update the data model. ","result":"Knockout JS has the feature of automatic UI updates when the data model is updated."},{"tag":"td","original":" In MVC, the UI part is not automatically updated when your data model is updated. It needs an event to call the data model and update it. ","result":"The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture doesn't provide automatic updates to the user interface when changes are made to the data model. Instead, an event must be triggered to update the data model and then update the UI accordingly."},{"tag":"td","original":" In Knockout JS, the model part is not directly bound with the view page. Models bind with the view-model and view-model directly with the view page. ","result":"Knockout JS operates in a way that the model component does not directly bind with the view page. Instead, it is associated with the view-model, which then binds with the view page."},{"tag":"td","original":" Model parts directly bind with the view page. ","result":"The components of the model are connected to the view page in a direct manner."},{"tag":"p","original":" The dependency tracking algorithm works in the following way: ","result":"The method for tracing dependencies operates as follows:"},{"tag":"li","original":" Whenever we declare a computed observable, KO immediately invokes its evaluator function to get its initial value. ","result":"When a computed observable is declared, Knockout (KO) executes its evaluator function straight away to get the initial value."},{"tag":"li","original":" While your evaluator function is running, KO keeps a log of any observables (or computed observables) that your evaluator reads the value of. ","result":"During the execution of your evaluator function, KO maintains a record of any observable variables or computed observables that are accessed by your evaluator function."},{"tag":"li","original":" When your evaluator is finished, KO sets up subscriptions to each of the observables (or computed observables) that you've touched. The subscription callback is set to cause your evaluator to run again, looping the whole process back to step 1 (disposing of any old subscriptions that no longer apply). ","result":"Once your evaluator is complete, KO establishes subscriptions for every observable and computed observable that you've utilized. These subscriptions are configured to trigger your evaluator once again, starting the entire process from the beginning (while also disposing of unnecessary previous subscriptions)."},{"tag":"li","original":" KO notifies any subscribers about the new value of your computed observable. ","result":"When a computed observable in Knockout.js is updated, it automatically notifies all its subscribers of the new value."},{"tag":"p","original":" The KO is known as the heart and soul of Knockout JS. It is used to provide an interdependent way to link the ViewModel to Model and ViewModel to UI (user interface). ","result":"The KO library is an essential component of Knockout JS, enabling the ViewModel to be connected to both the Model and UI in a mutually dependent way."},{"tag":"p","original":" The KO does not depend on the jQuery library, but we can use jQuery simultaneously. Using KO, you can simply handle client and server-side applications. ","result":"KO is an independent library that doesn't rely on jQuery. However, it can be used in conjunction with jQuery. KO enables the management of both client and server-side applications with ease."},{"tag":"p","original":" We can easily prepare a Knockout object for data transfer by serializing JSON using ko.toJSON(viewModel) and a simple JavaScript object using ko toJS(viewModel). ","result":"An efficient method to create a Knockout object that can be used for data transfer is by using the ko.toJSON() function to serialize the object to JSON format or ko.toJS() function to convert the object to a simple JavaScript object using the Knockout library."},{"tag":"p","original":" When you have an array of items in a Knockout ViewModel, you can tell your mark-up to iterate through them using the data-bind 'for-each' for example.  ","result":"In a Knockout ViewModel, it is possible to have an array of items that can be iterated through in the markup using the 'for-each' data-bind attribute."},{"tag":"p","original":" To delete an item from a Knockout array, we should use the remove or removeAll methods. You have to pass these methods in the item you want to match for deletion. ","result":"To remove an item from a Knockout array, one can make use of two methods: remove and removeAll. These methods require the item that matches the one to be removed to be passed in as a parameter."},{"tag":"p","original":" A viewModel in Knockout JS is a basic class that is created as JavaScript function. It is declared as a variable that have member variables and methods. ","result":"A viewModel is a fundamental construct in Knockout JS that functions as a JavaScript class. It is defined as a variable that contains properties and functions."},{"tag":"p","original":" As a normal functionality, we might implement around form fields such as getting/setting the field value, hooking events, etc., which can be carried out using 'form data-bind.' The benefit of using Knockout form binding is that it allows control of the form to be tied to the data model and its rules.  ","result":"One common practice in web development is to perform certain actions on form fields such as retrieving or updating their values, and attaching event listeners. This can be achieved through a process called 'form data-binding'. The advantage of using Knockout form binding is that it enables developers to link the form to a data model and its associated rules, providing greater control over the form's behavior."},{"tag":"a","original":" Company Interview Questions &amp; Procedure ","result":"Here is the rephrased content:\n\nThe process of conducting an interview with a company typically involves a series of questions designed to assess a candidate's credentials, qualifications, and fit for the organization.
