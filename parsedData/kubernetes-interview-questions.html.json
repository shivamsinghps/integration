The Kubernetes components, such as kubelet, take up resources on your nodes, and you still need more capacity for the node to do any task. In the larger cluster, it is always preferred to create a mix of different instance sizes. So, the Kubernetes can easily schedule the pods that require a lot of memory with intensive compute workloads on large nodes, and smaller nodes can handle smaller pods.  ","result":"The size of nodes in a Kubernetes cluster can vary, as different instances may have varying resource requirements depending on the specific tasks they are intended to perform. Apart from the nodes themselves, there are also Kubernetes components that require resources, which must also be taken into account. In larger clusters, a mixture of different node sizes is often used to ensure that pods with varying resource requirements can be scheduled appropriately. Larger nodes are ideal for more memory-intensive workloads with substantial computing requirements, while smaller nodes are better suited for smaller pods."},{"tag":"p","original":" A ContainerCreating pod is a specific type of pod scheduled on a node but can't start up properly.
