Data-binding is a feature of Angular, which is used to provide a way to communicate between the component (Model) and its view (HTML template). There are two ways of data-binding, one-way data binding and two-way data binding. In Angular, data from the component can be inserted inside the HTML template. Any changes in the component will directly reflect inside the HTML template in one-way binding, but vice-versa is not possible. On the other hand, it is possible in two-way binding. ","result":"Data-binding is a crucial feature of Angular that allows effective communication between a component and its corresponding view. The process can be achieved via two-way or one-way data-binding, each with its unique advantages.
