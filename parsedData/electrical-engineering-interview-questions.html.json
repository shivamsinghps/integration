It is a central part of Synchronous Generators and is used to regulate the voltage. It gets the fluctuation in the voltage and changes them into a constant voltage. The fluctuation in the voltage generally occurs due to the variation in load on the supply system, which can damage the equipment of the power system. To control the voltage, we have to install the voltage control equipment at several places such as near the transformers, generator, feeders, etc.  ","result":"The Automatic Voltage Regulator, commonly abbreviated as AVR, is a crucial component in Synchronous Generators that helps regulate the voltage. Its primary function is to maintain a consistent voltage by addressing any fluctuations in the electrical supply system. These voltage fluctuations can be caused by varying loads and have the potential to damage the power system's equipment. Installing voltage control devices near transformers, feeders, and generators is critical to controlling these fluctuations."},{"tag":"p","original":" SF6 gas is known as Sulphur Hexafluoride gas. This gas is used to extinguish the arc because it is an excellent dielectric, arc quenching, and has chemical and other physical properties, making it superior to other arc quenching mediums such as oil or air. Due to this reason, it is called a circuit breaker. The SF6 circuit breaker is mainly divided into three types: ","result":"Sulphur Hexafluoride gas, commonly known as SF6 gas, is used to extinguish electrical arcs in circuit breakers.
