This is the ID that we receive from the rest of API for the resource that we are querying. On the other hand, the \"cid\" is a temporary ID assigned to each model and is useful until an actual ID is assigned for the object. For example, a model pushed to a collection that has not yet been persisted can be called \"cid\", until it is saved in the database and an actual ID is generated for it. After that, it can be called \"id\". ","result":"In Backbone.js, every model has two types of IDs. The first is the \"id\" property, which is automatically assigned based on the data received from the API. The second is the \"cid\" property, which serves as a temporary ID until the object is saved to the database and assigned a new \"id\". The \"cid\" can be useful for managing new models within a collection before they are persisted."},{"tag":"p","original":" There are mainly two advantages to using \"listenTo()\" instead of using \"on()\" to bind event handlers.

The syntax for these two methods is different, and they each have unique advantages."},{"tag":"p","original":" While using \"listenTo()\", the object whose events you want to listen to is passed as the first argument. On the other hand, in the case of \"on()\", it is a method on that object. ","result":"The \"listenTo()\" function requires you to pass the object you want to monitor for events as its first argument. In contrast, the \"on()\" method is called directly on the object to be monitored."},{"tag":"strong","original":" The key advantages of \"listenTo()\" over \"on()\" are: ","result":"\"listenTo()\" has several benefits in comparison to \"on()\"."},{"tag":"li","original":" The listener keeps track of all the event handlers, making it easier to remove them all at once when required. ","result":"One of the benefits of using a listener in programming is that it allows for easy management of event handlers. The listener can keep track of all the event handlers, which makes it simple to remove them all at once when necessary."},{"tag":"li","original":" The callback's context is always set to the listener itself. ","result":"The context of the callback function always points to the listener that it is associated with."},{"tag":"p","original":" In Backbone.js, by default, collections are not explicitly sorted. We can sort the collections by defining a comparator on the collection object. By defining a comparator, a collection is sorted whenever a model is added or the \"sort()\" method is invoked on a collection: ","result":"Backbone.js collections are not inherently sorted, meaning that there is no default sorting order. However, users are able to sort collections by defining a comparator on the collection object. This allows for sorting to occur automatically whenever a new model is added to the collection, or whenever the \"sort()\" method is explicitly invoked."},{"tag":"p","original":" The comparator property can be a function with one argument or two arguments (similarly used in \"sort\"), or a string identifying the attribute by name to sort on. ","result":"The comparator property can use a function with one or two arguments (as used in \"sort\"), or a string that indicates the attribute to sort on by name. This means you have flexibility in how you choose to sort your data."},{"tag":"p","original":" When an attribute of a model in a collection changes, the collection doesn't sort itself. In this case, the sort must be invoked explicitly to update the order of models in the collection. ","result":"When a particular attribute of a model within a collection is altered, the collection will not automatically reorganize itself according to the new attribute value. To update the positioning of the models in the collection, it is necessary to manually initiate the sorting process."},{"tag":"p","original":" To override the Backbone.js's default behavior on a per-model basis for REST APIs, we can set a custom function to \"Model.sync\". To make the changing global, we can set the custom function to \"Backbone.sync\". Ideally, the \"sync\" function should handle four methods: \"create\", \"read\", \"update\", and \"delete\". The function receives the CRUD method name, the model itself, and an object with additional options. ","result":"One way to customize Backbone.js's handling of REST APIs for individual models is by setting a specific function to \"Model.sync\". This function can also be set to \"Backbone.sync\" to globally change the default behavior. A complete \"sync\" function should handle the four key methods of creating, reading, updating, and deleting, and receives input parameters including the method name, the model, and any other necessary options."},{"tag":"p","original":" There is also a method to do the same. Sometimes setting \"Backbone.emulateJSON\" to true can do the job, in this case we have to submit requests as \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" instead of \"application/json\".

Let's see what the uses of \":params\" and \"*splats are\": ","result":"Sure, here's my attempt to rephrase the content in my own words:\n\nWhen designing routes in Backbone.js, developers can utilize two types of variables - \":params\" and \"*splats\". These variables help create more flexible and dynamic routes. The use of \":params\" involves defining specific segments in the route that can be accessed as variables in code. On the other hand, \"*splats\" allow developers to capture any number of segments in a route and pass them as an array to a function, enabling even more versatility in the routing implementation."},{"tag":"li","original":" \":params\" is used to match any URL components between slashes. You can specify a single fragment using \".params\". On the other hand, \"*splats\" is used to match any number of URL fragments after the query. Due to the nature of a \"*splat\", it should always be the last variable in your URL as it will match any components. ","result":"\":params\" is a feature used in URL routing to define and match any components of a URL between slashes. This feature allows you to specify a particular fragment using \".params\". On the other hand, \"*splats\" is another feature used for matching any number of URL fragments following the query. It is important to note that \"*splats\" should always be the last variable in your URL, as it has the capability to match any components."},{"tag":"li","original":" In route definitions, the \"*splats\" or \":params\" are passed as arguments (in respective order) to the associated function. A route defined as \"/:route/:action\" will pass 2 variables (\"route\" and \"action\") to the callback function. ","result":"When defining routes, any \"*splats\" or \":params\" that are included will be passed as arguments to the function associated with that route. For example, if you define a route as \"/:route/:action\", two variables named \"route\" and \"action\" will be passed to the callback function in that order. This enables you to access and process these variables within the function as needed."},{"tag":"p","original":" Yes, we can use Backbone.js for a multiple-page web app. There are a lot of considerations for multiple page web apps in Backbone.js, but the following two are the most useful: ","result":"Certainly!
