However, there may be some errors in this calculation due to measurement uncertainties or rounding. To determine the percentage error in the calculated area, you can use the formula (error/actual value) × 100. For example, if you measured the length and width of a rectangle as 10 cm and 20 cm, respectively, but they could be off by 2% due to instrument calibration or human error, the actual values could range from 9.8 cm to 10.2 cm and from 19.6 cm to 20.4 cm, respectively. Therefore, the area calculation could be (9.8 cm × 19.6 cm) = 192.08 cm² or (10.2 cm × 20.4 cm) = 208.08 cm², which gives an average area of (192.08 cm² + 208.08 cm²)/2 = 200.08 cm². The percentage error in the calculated area is (2+ 2+ (2×2/100))% = 4.04%, which means that the actual area could be as low as 192.08 cm² - 4.04% = 184.47 cm² or as high as 208.08 cm² + 4.04% = 216.56 cm²."},{"tag":"p","original":"  Answer:  D ","result":"Reword the given text so that it is not copied from the original source."},{"tag":"p","original":"  Explanation:   ","result":"Rewritten: The content should be reworded in order to avoid any allegations of plagiarism."},{"tag":"p","original":"  Total number of possible outcomes of rolling a dice = ","result":"The number of possible outcomes when rolling a single dice can be determined."},{"tag":"p","original":"  Answer:  B ","result":"Reword the given text to avoid any similarity with the original text."},{"tag":"p","original":"  Explanation:   ","result":"The following game-changing concept was introduced by Amazon - a smart speaker called Alexa that can be controlled through voice commands and can perform a vast array of tasks like playing music, answering questions, updating the news, setting alarms, and even ordering products directly from Amazon."},{"tag":"p","original":"  Let the period be n year","result":"Reword the information to express the same meaning without copying the original text: \"The term of the agreement will be for a duration of n years.\""},{"tag":"p","original":"  (a)\t Odometer : Mileage,  Compass : ","result":"(a) Odometer and mileage are interchangeable terms used to describe the distance traveled by a vehicle.
