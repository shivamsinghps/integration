It can be used in locations that receive data. It is used because sometimes, it is convenient to destructure an object into several variables. ","result":"Destructuring is a feature in Kotlin that allows you to easily extract multiple values from objects or arrays. It is useful when you need to extract data from various objects and store them in separate variables. This feature is commonly used in places where data is being received or manipulated. By destructuring an object, you can easily extract its values and assign them to variables for further processing."},{"tag":"p","original":" Now, we can use name and age independently as follows: ","result":"Here's a rephrased version of the content:\n\nAfter collecting personal information from customers such as their names and ages, businesses can analyze and use this data to better target their marketing efforts. By understanding the age demographics of their audience, businesses can tailor their products or services to appeal to certain age groups. Additionally, knowing a customer's name can lead to a more personalized and friendly interaction between the customer and the business. Ultimately, collecting and utilizing this information can help businesses improve their overall customer experience."},{"tag":"p","original":" Unlike many other programming languages with similar capabilities, Kotlin doesn't have async and await keywords, and these keywords are not even part of its standard library.

It offers a range of high-level coroutine-enabled components such as launch, async, and more. This library empowers developers to write asynchronous code sequentially using Kotlin Coroutines' API."},{"tag":"p","original":" According to Kotlin documentation, Coroutines are like lightweight threads. They are lightweight because while creating them, they don't allocate new threads. Instead, they use predefined thread pools and smart scheduling. Scheduling is the process of determining the work in a sequential process, and it decides which piece of work you will execute next. We can suspend and resume the Coroutines while execution. This means we can have a long-running task, which can be executed one by one. We can pause it any number of times and resume it when required. ","result":"Kotlin offers Coroutines, which are akin to threads but much lighter in weight. Unlike threads, Coroutines don't create new threads during initialization, but rather use pre-existing thread pools that come with intelligent scheduling capabilities. Scheduling decides which task needs to be executed next in a sequence. Coroutines can be suspended and resumed during their execution, allowing for sequential processing of a long-running task that can bepaused and resumed as needed."},{"tag":"p","original":" In Kotlin, the main difference between Launch and Async is that the launch{} does not return anything and the async{} returns an instance of Deferred, which has an await() function. In other words, we can say that launch is used to fire and forget, and async is used to perform a task and return a result. ","result":"In Kotlin, Launch and Async have distinctly different functions. The launch{} method does not produce a result and is used simply to execute a task and move on. The async{} method, on the other hand, returns a Deferred object, which has an await() method to obtain the results of the computation. These two methods effectively enable developers to either dispatch a task and not wait for its output or to execute a task and receive its result."},{"tag":"p","original":" Extension functions are like extensive properties attached to any class in Kotlin. Extension functions are used to add methods or functionalities to an existing class even without inheriting the class.

So, we can create an extension function for views as follows: ","result":"In Kotlin, extension functions are properties that can be added to a class without inheriting from it. They are used to add new functionalities or methods to an existing class. For instance, if we have views that require manipulation of their visibility, we can create an extension function that performs this function for all views."},{"tag":"p","original":" The Kotlin double-bang (!!) operator converts any value to a non-null type and throws a KotlinNullPointerException exception if the value is null.
