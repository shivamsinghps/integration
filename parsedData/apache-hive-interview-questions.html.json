This is because SORT BY sorts the data by leveraging multiple reducers, whereas ORDER BY sorts all the data simultaneously using only one reducer."},{"tag":"p","original":" Hence, if you use the ORDER BY clause, it will take a lot of time to execute many inputs. So, in this case, SORT BY is preferred over ORDER BY. ","result":"When dealing with a large volume of input, using the ORDER BY clause can be inefficient and time-consuming to execute. In such a scenario, it is advisable to use the SORT BY clause instead of ORDER BY to improve performance."},{"tag":"p","original":" The TIMESTAMP data type in Hive is used to store all data information in the java.sql.timestamp format.
