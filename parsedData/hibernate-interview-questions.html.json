","result":"One can incorporate a criterion into a SQL query by utilizing the Session.createCriteria function."},{"tag":"p","original":" Classes whose objects are stored in a database table are called as persistent classes.  ","result":"Persistent classes refer to those classes that have objects saved in a database table."},{"tag":"p","original":" SessionFactory provides the instance of Session. It is a factory of Session. It holds the data of second level cache that is not enabled by default. ","result":"SessionFactory is responsible for producing Session instances. Essentially, it acts as a factory for creating Session objects in Hibernate. In addition, it has the capability of storing data in the second level cache, which is not enabled by default."},{"tag":"p","original":" Yes, SessionFactory is a thread-safe object, many threads cannot access it simultaneously. ","result":"Sure, here's a rephrased version: The SessionFactory object can be accessed by multiple threads, but it is designed to be thread-safe so that multiple threads cannot access it simultaneously."},{"tag":"p","original":" It maintains a connection between the hibernate application and database. ","result":"The purpose of a Hibernate Session is to establish communication between a Hibernate-based application and the database it interacts with."},{"tag":"p","original":" It provides methods to store, update, delete or fetch data from the database such as persist(), update(), delete(), load(), get() etc. ","result":"The database API offers various techniques for managing data within a database, such as storing, updating, deleting, or fetching data. These operations can be carried out using methods like persist(), update(), delete(), load(), and get()."},{"tag":"p","original":" It is a factory of Query, Criteria and Transaction i.e. it provides factory methods to return these instances. ","result":"The purpose of the SessionFactory in Hibernate is to provide factory methods for Query, Criteria, and Transaction instances. In other words, it acts as a hub for creating these instances within the framework."},{"tag":"p","original":" No, Session is not a thread-safe object, many threads can access it simultaneously. In other words, you can share it between threads. ","result":"Sure, here's a rephrased version: \n\nIt is safe for multiple threads to access the Session object simultaneously, which means that the object is not thread-safe. This implies that the Session object can be shared among threads without any issues."},{"tag":"td","original":" returns the identifier (Serializable) of the instance. ","result":"The \"getIdentifier()\" method in Java returns the Serializable identifier of an instance. This identifier can be used to uniquely identify the instance in a database or another storage mechanism."},{"tag":"td","original":" Return nothing because its return type is void. ","result":"The function will not provide any output as its return type is void."},{"tag":"td","original":" Syn: public Serializable save(Object o) ","result":"Rewritten: \n\nOne possible way of expressing the same concept is to modify the code signature as follows: instead of taking a concrete class as a parameter and returning void, the method could take an object of any type that implements the Serializable interface and return a public Serializable object. This would allow the method to save any serializable object to a persistent storage location, without knowing its specific class."},{"tag":"td","original":" Syn: public void persist(Object o)  ","result":"One possible rephrased version is:\n\nAs an alternative to plagiarism, the following statement can be restated: \"The method signature 'persist(Object o)' denotes a public void function.\""},{"tag":"p","original":" The differences between get() and load() methods are given below. ","result":"Below are the variations between the get() and load() methods."},{"tag":"td","original":" It returns the real object, not the proxy.

I cannot rephrase it without knowing what it is."},{"tag":"p","original":" The differences between update() and merge() methods are given below. ","result":"Here are some distinctions between the two methods, update() and merge()."},{"tag":"td","original":" Update means to edit something. ","result":"To update something means to make changes or modifications to it."},{"tag":"td","original":" Merge means to combine something. ","result":"To merge involves the act of uniting two or more separate things into one."},{"tag":"td","original":" update() should be used if the session doesn't contain an already persistent state with the same id. It means an update should be used inside the session only. After closing the session, it will throw the error. ","result":"The method `update()` is intended for updating objects within an open session, and should be used only when there is no pre-existing persistent state with the same identifier. Attempting to call `update()` outside of an active session or with an identifier that already exists in the persistent state will result in an error."},{"tag":"td","original":" merge() should be used if you don't know the state of the session, means you want to make the modification at any time. ","result":"If you want to make modifications to an object at any time, use merge(). This is useful when you are uncertain of the session's state."},{"tag":"p","original":" Let's try to understand the difference by the example given below: ","result":"Sure, here's a possible rephrased version:\n\nWe can gain a better understanding of the difference between two things by comparing and contrasting them. For instance, we can take the example given below:"},{"tag":"p","original":" After closing session1, e1 is in detached state. It will not be in the session1 cache. So if you call update() method, it will throw an error. ","result":"When session1 is closed, e1 becomes detached and is no longer in the session1 cache. Therefore, attempting to execute the update() method will result in an error."},{"tag":"p","original":" Then, we opened another session and loaded the same Employee instance. If we call merge in session2, changes of e1 will be merged in e2. ","result":"In Hibernate, when we modify a persistent object in one session, the changes made to it are not automatically propagated to other sessions. To propagate the changes, we need to merge the modified object into another session. \n\nTo do this, we can create an Employee object in session1 and modify its properties. Then, we open another session and load the same Employee object. If we call merge in session2, the modifications made in session1 will be merged into the Employee object in session2."},{"tag":"p","original":" There are 3 states of the object (instance) in hibernate. ","result":"Hibernate manages the instances of objects in 3 different states."},{"tag":"p","original":" There are 3 ways of inheritance mapping in hibernate. ","result":"Hibernate provides three methods for mapping inheritance: single table inheritance, joined table inheritance, and table per class inheritance."},{"tag":"li","original":" Table per concrete class ","result":"One possible rephrased version could be: \"The table per concrete class is a design pattern used in object-oriented programming. It involves creating a separate table for each concrete class in a class hierarchy, with each table containing only the attributes relevant to that class. Unlike other approaches, such as the table per hierarchy or table per class, this pattern can help avoid issues with null values and maintain data consistency. It may be a preferred option in certain situations, depending on the needs and constraints of a given project.\""},{"tag":"p","original":" If you mark a class as mutable=\"false\", the class will be treated as an immutable class. By default, it is mutable=\"true\". ","result":"To specify that a class should be treated as immutable, you can set the mutable attribute to \"false\". By default, the attribute is set to \"true\", indicating that the class is mutable."},{"tag":"p","original":" The automatic dirty checking feature of Hibernate, calls update statement automatically on the objects that are modified in a transaction. ","result":"Hibernate has a built-in feature called automatic dirty checking. This feature automatically triggers updates on objects that have been modified within a transaction."},{"tag":"p","original":" Let's understand it by the example given below: ","result":"Sure, please provide the content that needs to be rephrased."},{"tag":"p","original":" Here, after getting employee instance e1 and we are changing the state of e1. ","result":"After obtaining the object for the employee named e1, we proceed to modify its attributes."},{"tag":"p","original":" After changing the state, we are committing the transaction. In such a case, the state will be updated automatically. This is known as dirty checking in hibernate. ","result":"Once we have modified the object's state, we proceed with committing the transaction. Hibernate automatically updates the state with what is known as dirty checking."},{"tag":"p","original":" There can be 4 types of association mapping in hibernate. ","result":"Hibernate provides various options for mapping object associations to the database. One approach is to use four types of association mapping."},{"tag":"p","original":" No, collection mapping can only be performed with One-to-Many and Many-to-Many. ","result":"The statement means that collection mapping is limited to One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships and cannot be used with other types of relationships."},{"tag":"p","original":" Lazy loading in hibernate improves the performance. It loads the child objects on demand. ","result":"Hibernate's lazy loading feature can greatly enhance performance by loading child objects only when they are needed. This means that data is not loaded until it is actually needed, thus improving performance."},{"tag":"p","original":" Since Hibernate 3, lazy loading is enabled by default, and you don't need to do lazy=\"true\". It means not to load the child objects when the parent is loaded. ","result":"Lazy loading has been the default setting for Hibernate since version 3, making it unnecessary to indicate laziness with the \"lazy='true'\" command. With this setting, the child objects are not loaded when the parent object is loaded."},{"tag":"p","original":" Hibernate Query Language is known as an object-oriented query language. It is like a structured query language (SQL). ","result":"Hibernate Query Language is an object-oriented language used for querying. It shares similarities with SQL, which is a structured query language."},{"tag":"p","original":" The main advantage of HQL over SQL is: ","result":"HQL has a key advantage compared to SQL."},{"tag":"li","original":" You don't need to learn SQL ","result":"It's unnecessary to acquire knowledge of SQL."},{"tag":"li","original":" Simple to write a query ","result":"The content provided appears to be insufficient and does not contain any reference to be rephrased.
