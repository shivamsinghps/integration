The object that the request refers to:"},{"tag":"p","original":"  c. Request Header Fields: The request-header fields are used to allow the client to pass additional information to the server like the request and the client itself. The request header fields act as request modifiers, with semantics equivalent to the parameters on a programming language method invocation. ","result":"The request header fields allow clients to provide additional information to servers, which include information about the request and the client. These fields act as modifiers and function similarly to parameters used in programming language method requests."},{"tag":"p","original":" This method retrieves information from the given server using a given URI. GET request can retrieve the data. It cannot apply other effects on the data. ","result":"The process of fetching data from a server through a specified URI is known as the GET request method. The GET method is used to retrieve data and cannot modify or alter it."},{"tag":"p","original":" The HEAD method is the same as the GET method. It is used to transfer the status line and header section only. ","result":"The functionality of the HEAD method is identical to that of the GET method, as it is designed to only send the status line and header section of a HTTP request."},{"tag":"p","original":" The POST request sends the data to the server. For example, file upload, customer information, etc. using the HTML forms. ","result":"The POST method is used to transfer data from the client-side to the server-side. This type of request is commonly used for a variety of purposes, like uploading files or submitting customer information via HTML forms."},{"tag":"p","original":" The PUT method is used to replace all the current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content. ","result":"PUT method is utilized for replacing all the existing versions of the target resource with the newly uploaded content."},{"tag":"p","original":" The DELETE method is used to remove all the current representations of the target resource, which is given by URI. ","result":"The DELETE method is utilized to eliminate all existing depictions of the intended resource, identified by a URI."},{"tag":"p","original":" The CONNECT method is used to establish a tunnel to the server, which is identified by a given URI.

However, HTTP/1.1 introduced the keep-alive mechanism, which enables the reuse of a connection for multiple requests and responses."},{"tag":"p","original":" Session state is also known as Stateless state. HTTP is a stateless protocol. In the session state, the client and server just know about each other only during the current request. If the connection is closed, and two computers want to connect again, they need to provide information to each other as a new connection, and the connection is handled as the very first one. ","result":"Session state, also referred to as stateless state, pertains to the limited exchange of information between a client and server during the current request. Because HTTP is a stateless protocol, each new connection requires both parties to provide information again as if it were the initial connection. Any subsequent connection is handled as if it were the first, making it necessary to go through the same process repeatedly."},{"tag":"p","original":"  HTTP Message is used to show how data is exchanged between the client and the server. It is based on a client-server architecture. An  HTTP  client is a program that establishes a connection to a server to send one or more HTTP request messages. An  HTTP  server is a program that accepts connections to serve HTTP requests by sending an HTTP response messages. ","result":"HTTP Message serves as a means of demonstrating the exchange of data between a client and server in a client-server model. A program known as an HTTP client initiates a connection to a server to transmit one or more HTTP request messages. The HTTP server, on the other hand, is responsible for receiving connections and processing HTTP requests by transmitting HTTP response messages."},{"tag":"p","original":" HTTP cURL is a command-line tool. It is available on all major operating systems ","result":"HTTP cURL is a tool that is accessed through the command line interface, and it is compatible with all of the most commonly used operating systems."},{"tag":"p","original":" HTTP Response sent by a server to the client.

","result":"HTTPS is an abbreviation of \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\". Its purpose is to provide secure transfer of data. HTTPS is used to encrypt the user's HTTP page or HTTP page requests that are received by the web server."},{"tag":"p","original":"  Most of the responses of HTTP include an entity which contains the information for interpretation by a user. Naturally, it is used to supply the user with the best available entity corresponding to the request. Unfortunately for cache and server, not all users have the same preferences for what is best. That's why HTTP has provisions for several mechanisms for  \"content negotiation\",  when there are multiple representations available, the process of selecting the best representation for a given response. ","result":"HTTP responses typically come with an entity that provides information for users to interpret. This entity is meant to give users the most appropriate representation of the requested information. However, different users may have different preferences on what's best.
