It involves adding a cost term to the objective function to encourage the model to reduce the coefficients or weights of many variables to zero. By doing this, the model becomes less complex, and it can improve its predictive accuracy and generalize better. The main aim of regularization is to reduce the complexity of the model and ensure that it is not too focused on the training data but can perform well on the test data."},{"tag":"p","original":" A regularization is a form of regression, which constrains/ regularizes or shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero. In other words, it discourages learning a more complex or flexible model to avoid the risk of overfitting. It reduces the variance of the model, without a substantial increase in its bias.  ","result":"Regularization is a statistical technique which is used to restrict the magnitude of the coefficient estimates toward zero. It is similar to regression, and its primary aim is to prevent overfitting by discouraging the model from learning complex patterns that may not generalize well to new data. This technique helps to decrease the variance of the model without significantly increasing bias."},{"tag":"p","original":" Regularization is used to address overfitting problems as it penalizes the loss function by adding a multiple of an L1 (LASSO) or an L2 (Ridge) norm of weights vector w. ","result":"Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where the model performs well on the training set but poorly on the testing set. To combat this issue, regularization is used to penalize the loss function by introducing a multiple of either L1 (LASSO) or L2 (Ridge) norms of the weights vector, w. This helps to prevent extreme values in the weights and encourages a simpler, more generalizable model."},{"tag":"p","original":" Most Machine learning algorithms require number as input.
