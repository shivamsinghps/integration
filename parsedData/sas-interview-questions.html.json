This is the main difference between reading data from existing datas sets and reading data from external files. ","result":"When importing data into SAS, the program behaves differently depending on whether the data is being read from an existing dataset or from an external file. In the case of an existing dataset, SAS retains the value of variables from one observation to the next corresponding observation. However, when reading data from an external file, SAS only reads the observations and does not hold onto the variables' values unless they are explicitly declared. This key difference is crucial to keep in mind when working with data in SAS."},{"tag":"p","original":" It can be explained with a simple example when SAS does not automatically change the character value to a numeric value. Just assume a variable named 'PayRate', and its value starts with a dollar sign ($). In this case, SAS cannot convert or change the values of 'PayRate' to numeric values because the dollar sign prevents the process from being completed. Whenever SAS tries to automatically convert the values, the dollar sign blocks the entire process. As a result, the values don't get converted to numeric values. ","result":"There are scenarios in which SAS cannot automatically convert a character value to a numeric value. An instance of this is when a variable, such as 'PayRate,' begins with a dollar sign ($). SAS cannot proceed with the automatic conversion because the presence of the dollar sign inhibits the process. This results in the values remaining unconverted to numeric values."},{"tag":"p","original":" That is why it is recommended to use INPUT and PUT functions with programs in case of conversions.
