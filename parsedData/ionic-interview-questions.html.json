The main idea behind this concept is that we do not need to load every page in the application when the application is launched. In the previous versions of Ionic framework, it is recommended to use @IonicPage decorator to lazy load your pages, but now in the latest version of Ionic (Ionic 4), we lazy load our Angular components with Angular routing. ","result":"Lazy loading is an approach that allows us to load pages or components only when they are needed instead of loading everything upfront when an application is launched. This helps to improve performance and reduce load times. In previous versions of the Ionic framework, the recommended way to implement lazy loading was by using the @IonicPage decorator. However, in the latest version, Ionic 4, Angular routing is used to implement lazy loading of Angular components."},{"tag":"p","original":" We know that every Ionic component is a web component, and these components will be lazily loaded only when they are accesses in the Ionic application. It means that the code for &lt;ion-button&gt; and &lt;ion-tab&gt; will only be loaded when they are accessed in the application. ","result":"Ionic components are essentially web components that are designed to be loaded lazily. This means that their code will only be loaded when they are accessed within the Ionic application. For example, the code for &lt;ion-button&gt; and &lt;ion-tab&gt; will only be loaded if and when they are required within the application."},{"tag":"p","original":" Some of the popular apps built with the Ionic Framework are listed below.

It provides more consistent routing experience into the whole app. The previous versions of Ionic use NavController service for navigation, which is still there, but it will be deprecated soon. Thus, it will not be recommended in the new Ionic apps built with Ionic 4. ","result":"Ionic 4 is built on Angular, which uses the RouterModule module for navigation. This creates a more unified navigation experience across the entire app. NavController, which was used in prior versions of Ionic, is still available but will be phased out in the future and is not recommended for use in new Ionic 4 applications."},{"tag":"p","original":" In the latest version of Ionic, the ion-router-outlet component is used to manage the animations that show up as the user navigates to or from a component within the app. The ion-router-outlet works the same as the Angular router-outlet with some animation effect. ","result":"Ionic has incorporated the ion-router-outlet component in its latest version to facilitate smooth transitions when users navigate to or from a component within the app. This component is similar to Angular's router-outlet, but includes animation effects for a more engaging user experience."},{"tag":"p","original":" We know that Ionic apps are built using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These web technologies are rendered using Web Views, which are full screen and full-powered web browser.

It is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, have permission to access selected resources from a different origin. ","result":"CORS is an acronym that stands for cross-origin resource sharing. It employs special HTTP headers to enable a web application running on one origin to access certain resources from another origin with permission from the browser."},{"tag":"p","original":" A web application makes a cross-origin request for a resource like an image or a font outside of the origin, and CORS manages these cross-origin requests. The CORS standard is necessary because it allows servers to specify who can access its assets and how the assets can be accessed. ","result":"Cross-origin requests are commonly made by web applications for resources such as images or fonts that are outside of the web application's domain. CORS is implemented to manage these requests by allowing servers to specify access control policies for their assets. The CORS standard is critical because it enables servers to control access to their resources and determine how they can be accessed."},{"tag":"p","original":" For security reasons, the browser restricts cross-origin requests initiated within scripts. The CORS needs to be handled on the server. When responding to HTTP requests in your server app, you can add the CORS response headers to specify that the client app can access a resource or not. If the CORS is not implemented on the server, then there is a native plugin available that performs HTTP requests in the native layer, which bypasses CORS. Thus, external services can properly handle cross-origin requests. ","result":"When a script initiates a cross-origin request, the browser restricts it for security purposes. As a result, server-side handling of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is necessary. To enable a client application to access a resource, or restrict it, the server can include CORS response headers in its HTTP response. Failing to implement CORS on the server can lead to limited functionality. However, the use of a native plugin that bypasses CORS can allow external services to handle cross-origin requests, albeit not in a secure manner."},{"tag":"p","original":" The ionic framework provides a storage module that resides in @ionic/storage package. The storage module allows us to store key-value pairs and JSON objects in secure, reliable storage. It also has its own set of limits.

This module gives developers the ability to store data in a secure and reliable manner, using key-value pairs or JSON objects. However, the module has specific limitations that users should keep in mind when utilizing it for storage purposes."},{"tag":"p","original":" Storage has a variety of storage engines, which one is best depends on the platform you are using. When running in a native app context, the storage uses SQLite. When running on the Web or as a Progressive Web App, Storage will use IndexedDB, WebSQL, and localstorage. ","result":"Storage has several storage engines to choose from, with the ideal one being determined by the platform you're operating on. For instance, SQLite is utilized when operating in a native app context. Meanwhile, IndexedDB, WebSQL, and localstorage are employed when operating on the web or as a Progressive Web App."},{"tag":"p","original":" The SQLite is the most stable and used a file-based database, which avoids the pitfalls of the other storage engines like IndexedDB, WebSQL, and localstorage. ","result":"SQLite is an extremely reliable and widely utilized database that operates using files instead of other storage engines such as WebSQL, IndexedDB, and localstorage. As a result, it avoids the challenges associated with those other engines."},{"tag":"p","original":" The size of the Ionic app can be reduced in the following ways: ","result":"Here is a rephrased version of the content:\n\nYou can decrease the overall size of your Ionic application by implementing various tactics such as compressing images, eliminating unused code, minimizing the number of plugins used, and optimizing the app's configuration. Utilizing these strategies can enhance the app's performance and lead to a better user experience."},{"tag":"li","original":" First, compress all the screenshots and icons and deletes all unwanted icons. If you use portrait mode, keep only portrait screenshots, and if you are using landscape mode, keep all the screenshots landscape. ","result":"To make your app's store listing more efficient, start by compressing all screenshots and icons. Remove any unnecessary icons and keep only the relevant ones for your app. If you're using portrait mode, stick to portrait screenshots, and if you're using landscape mode, use only landscape screenshots."},{"tag":"li","original":" Second, minify all JS and CSS files and update the index.html file accordingly. ","result":"There are two steps to be taken to optimize the website's performance. Firstly, by reducing the size of the images used on the site using image compression tools.
