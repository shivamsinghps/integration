These parts are distinct from integrated circuits and are often used in combination to create customized circuit designs. Some examples of discrete components used in embedded systems include resistors, capacitors, transistors, diodes, and sensors. By carefully selecting and combining these discrete components, engineers can create embedded systems that meet specific application requirements."},{"tag":"p","original":" A general rule specifies that the oscillator frequency directly determines the speed at which your application runs.

When we keep allocating and releasing memory spaces over time, in the end, we will get non-contiguous memory blocks that are free, and our in-use variables are scattered everywhere in the RAM. This is called memory fragmentation. This can potentially lead to dynamic memory allocation failure. For example, if you have to allocate an array of 100 integers and there is no contiguous block of memory with that space, this causes a runtime error. This is why we don't use dynamic memory allocation in embedded systems firmware in the first place. ","result":"Memory fragmentation is a common problem that occurs when using dynamic memory allocation. It happens when memory allocation and deallocation takes place frequently, leading to the creation of non-contiguous memory blocks. As a result, the in-use variables become scattered throughout the RAM, making it difficult to allocate a contiguous block of memory when needed. In worst-case scenarios, memory fragmentation can cause dynamic memory allocation to fail. This is especially problematic when allocating large arrays as there may not be enough contiguous blocks of memory to fit the array.
