It enables access to the result once a single task execution is done, and the get method will be blocked if the computation is not achieved. Once the execution is completed, starting or canceling it is impossible."},{"tag":"p","original":" public class FutureTask&lt;V&gt; extends Object implements RunnableFuture&lt;V&gt; ","result":"The FutureTask class is an implementation of the RunnableFuture interface and provides a way to create and manage asynchronous tasks that can return a result. It allows a callable to be submitted for execution, and the result can be retrieved later. This class provides a powerful way to manage concurrent operations within an application."},{"tag":"a","original":" Java Collections interview Questions ","result":"Here are some potential questions you may encounter during an interview about Java Collections."},{"tag":"a","original":" Java Basics Interview Questions ","result":"Reword these interview questions relating to Java fundamentals so that they are not copied from their original source."},{"tag":"a","original":" Java OOPs Interview Questions ","result":"The following is a list of interview questions about Java object-oriented programming (OOP)."},{"tag":"a","original":" Java Multithreading Interview Questions ","result":"The following questions are meant to test an individual's knowledge and understanding of multithreading concepts in Java for an interview scenario."},{"tag":"a","original":" Java String &amp; Exception Interview Questions ","result":"The following are interview questions related to Java's String and Exception handling:\n\n1.
