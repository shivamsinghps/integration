Its advantages include a better understanding of test suite, support for multiple platforms, parallel testing, and providing detailed HTML reports."},{"tag":"li","original":" Number of test cases executed. ","result":"Reworded: The quantity of assessments conducted."},{"tag":"li","original":" Number of test cases passed. ","result":"The number of test cases that have been successfully executed and produced the expected output."},{"tag":"li","original":" Number of test cases failed. ","result":"The number of tests that have not passed is higher than expected."},{"tag":"li","original":" Number of test cases skipped ","result":"The number of tests that were not executed or omitted."},{"tag":"li","original":" Multiple test cases can be grouped easily by converting them into a testng.xml file, in which you can set the priority of each test case that determines which test case should be executed first. ","result":"A testng.xml file can be used to organize and prioritize multiple test cases. This file allows for grouping of test cases and setting the priority level for each case, determining the order in which they will be executed."},{"tag":"li","original":" With the help of TestNG, you can execute the multiple test cases on multiple browsers known as cross-browser testing. ","result":"TestNG is a tool that enables you to run multiple test cases on several browsers, which is commonly referred to as cross-browser testing."},{"tag":"li","original":" The TestNG framework can be easily integrated with other tools such as Maven. Jenkins, etc. ","result":"It is effortless to combine the TestNG framework with a range of other tools like Jenkins and Maven. This integration enables users to optimize software testing as part of the continuous integration and delivery pipeline."},{"tag":"li","original":" Annotations used in a TestNG framework are easily understandable such as @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod, @BeforeTest, @AfterTest. ","result":"In a TestNG framework, annotations are utilized to facilitate the understanding of the code. Some commonly used annotations include @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod, @BeforeTest, and @AfterTest."},{"tag":"li","original":" WebDriver does not generate the reports while TestNG generates the reports in a readable format. ","result":"In contrast to WebDriver, TestNG has the ability to generate readable reports, whereas WebDriver lacks this feature and does not produce any reports."},{"tag":"li","original":" TestNG simplifies the way the test cases are coded. We do not have to write the static main method. The sequence of actions is maintained by the annotations only. ","result":"TestNG makes writing test cases simpler by eliminating the need to include a static main method. The annotations handle the order in which actions are taken, removing the need for manual sequencing of test cases."},{"tag":"li","original":" TestNG allows you to execute the test cases separately. For example, if you have six test cases, then one method is written for each test case. When we run the program, five methods are executed successfully, and the sixth method is failed. To remove the error, we need to run only the sixth method, and this can be possible only through TestNG. Because TestNG generates testng-failed.xml file in the test output folder, we will run only this xml file to execute the failed test case. ","result":"TestNG has the capability to execute test cases individually, which can come handy when dealing with multiple test cases. Each test case can be written as its own method, allowing for easy identification of failed tests. By running only the failed test case, we can quickly isolate and fix any issues. TestNG simplifies this process by generating a testng-failed.xml file in the test output folder, which can be utilized to run only the failed test case."},{"tag":"p","original":" You can run the test script in TestNG by clicking right click on the TestNG class, click on \"Run As\" and then select \"TestNG test\".

","result":"TestNG's group feature enables the execution of several test cases simultaneously. Suppose we have 100 tests in the IT department and 10 in the HR department, and we want to run all of the IT department's tests in a single suite. In that case, we must use grouping."},{"tag":"strong","original":" Let's understand through an example. ","result":"Let me provide an example to help illustrate the concept."},{"tag":"p","original":" When we want to run the test cases in a specific order, then we use the concept of dependency in TestNG. ","result":"In TestNG, we have the option to establish dependencies between test cases to run them in a particular order. With this functionality, we can ensure that specific test cases run before or after others, allowing us to obtain consistent and predictable test results."},{"tag":"strong","original":" Two types of dependency attributes used in TestNG: ","result":"There are two different kinds of dependency attributes that are utilized in TestNG."},{"tag":"p","original":" While running test cases, there can be a case when some test cases take much more time than expected. In such a case, we can mark the test case as a failed test case by using timeOut. ","result":"During the process of running test cases, it is possible for certain test cases to take an unexpectedly long amount of time to complete. When faced with this issue, one solution is to designate the test case as a failure using the timeOut method."},{"tag":"p","original":" TimeOut in TestNG allows you to configure the time period to wait for a test to get completely executed. It can be configured in two levels: ","result":"TestNG provides the ability to set a timeout for test execution. This feature allows you to specify the amount of time a test should take to execute. The timeout feature can be set at two levels, giving you flexibility in managing tests."},{"tag":"strong","original":" At the suit level: ","result":"The following information needs to be rephrased to avoid plagiarism:\n\n\"At the suit level:\"\n\nRephrased:\n\n\"At the level of a legal action:\""},{"tag":"strong","original":" At each method level: ","result":"Rewritten: For each level of method, a distinct analysis and approach are followed."},{"tag":"p","original":" The timeOut attribute can be specified as shown below: ","result":"The following code demonstrates how to specify the timeOut attribute:"},{"tag":"p","original":" The above @Test annotation tells that the test method will be given 700 ms to complete its execution otherwise it will be marked as a failed test case. ","result":"The @Test annotation mentioned above indicates that the test method has a time limit of 700ms to finish its execution. If it exceeds this limit, the test case will fail."},{"tag":"p","original":" An invocationCount in TestNG is the number of times that we want to execute the same test. ","result":"TestNG provides an attribute called invocationCount, which allows us to define how many times a test should be executed. Using invocationCount, we can repeat the same test multiple times."},{"tag":"strong","original":" The testng.xml file is important because of the following reasons: ","result":"The testng.xml is a significant file for a number of reasons:"},{"tag":"li","original":" It defines the order of the execution of all the test cases. ","result":"This describes the sequence in which all the test cases will be executed."},{"tag":"li","original":" It allows you to group the test cases and can be executed as per the requirements. ","result":"The feature of test case prioritization enables grouping of test cases for execution based on specific requirements."},{"tag":"li","original":" It executes the selected test cases. ","result":"This action performs the chosen test cases."},{"tag":"li","original":" In TestNG, listeners can be implemented at the suite level. ","result":"TestNG provides the ability to implement listeners at a suite level, which can help in managing test cases effectively."},{"tag":"li","original":" It allows you to integrate the TestNG framework with tools such as Jenkins.

We can assign the false value to the enabled attribute, in this way we can disable the test case from running. ","result":"To prevent a test case from running, you can use the \"enabled\" attribute. This involves setting the attribute to \"false\"."},{"tag":"p","original":"  Soft Assertion:  In case of Soft Assertion, if TestNG gets an error during @Test, it will throw an exception when an assertion fails and continues with the next statement after the assert statement. ","result":"A Soft Assertion in TestNG handles errors differently than a regular Assertion. If TestNG encounters an error during a test, it will not cause the entire test to fail. Instead, the test will continue and the assertion failure will be recorded as a \"soft\" failure. This allows the test to complete and any other asserts to be checked."},{"tag":"p","original":"  Hard Assertion:  In the case of Hard Assertion, if TestNG gets an error during @Test, it will throw an AssertException immediately when an assertion fails and stops execution after the assert statement. ","result":"The Hard Assertion feature in TestNG is designed to throw an AssertException immediately when an assertion fails during @Test. This causes the execution to stop after the assert statement."},{"tag":"strong","original":" Let's understand through an example. ","result":"Here is an example to illustrate the point."},{"tag":"p","original":" TestNG provides different kinds of listeners which can perform different actions whenever the event is triggered. The most widely used listener in TestNG is ITestListener interface. The ITestListener interface contains methods such as onTestSuccess, onTestfailure, onTestSkipped, etc. ","result":"TestNG offers several listeners that are capable of performing various actions upon the occurrence of a specified event.
