By comparing the sum of all the elements in the given array with the sum of the integers from 1 to n (where n is the number of elements in the array), it identifies the missing element.

If the array has only one element, the program returns that element.\n\nThe program uses a quickselect algorithm to find the median in O(n) time on average, where n is the length of the array. This algorithm is based on the partition routine of the quicksort algorithm and provides a linear-time solution for selecting the kth smallest element in an unsorted array. The program also uses a random pivot to achieve a good expected performance even for worst-case inputs.\n\nThis program can be used in various contexts where the median of a dataset is needed, such as in statistics, finance, or data analysis.
