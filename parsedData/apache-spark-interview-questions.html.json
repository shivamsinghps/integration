It is performed after all the transformations applied on the RDD have been executed."},{"tag":"p","original":" Yarn is one of the most important features of Apache Spark. Apache Spark is an in-memory distributed data processing engine, and YARN is a cluster management technology that is used to run Spark. Yarn makes you able to dynamically share and centrally configure the same pool of cluster resources between all frameworks that run on Yarn. When Spark runs on Yarn, it makes the binary distribution as it is built on Yarn support.  ","result":"Yarn plays a crucial role in the functionality of Apache Spark. Apache Spark is a distributed data processing engine that operates mostly in-memory, while YARN is a cluster management tool that runs Spark. With YARN, it's possible to share and configure the same cluster resources among all frameworks that utilize YARN, making it very practical. When Spark utilizes YARN, it creates the binary distribution specifically for YARN, making it fully compatible."},{"tag":"p","original":" Apache Spark is the best fit for simple machine learning algorithms like clustering, regression, and classification, etc.  ","result":"The Apache Spark platform is most suitable for basic machine learning tasks such as grouping, prediction, and categorization, among others."},{"tag":"p","original":" In Apache Spark, checkpoints are used to allow the program to run all around the clock.

This lineage is used to keep track of what all transformations have to be applied on that RDD. It also traces the location from where it has to read the data. ","result":"In Apache Spark, transformations such as map or filter are not immediately executed, but instead create a lineage to track the necessary transformations and data location. This allows for efficient processing and management of the RDD."},{"tag":"p","original":" In Apache Spark, the lineage graph is a dependencies graph between existing RDD and new RDD. It specifies that all the dependencies between the RDD are recorded in a graph rather than the original data.
