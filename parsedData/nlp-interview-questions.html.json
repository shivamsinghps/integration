Textual data often contains noise in the form of irrelevant information, such as special characters, numbers, and stopwords, which can greatly affect the performance of natural language processing algorithms. Tokenization breaks down text into individual words or tokens, making it easier to analyze. Stopword removal involves eliminating commonly used words in a language that don't carry significant meaning, such as \"the\" and \"a\". Stemming consists of reducing words to their root form, such as converting \"running\" to \"run\", while lemmatization involves converting words to their base form based on their part of speech, such as converting \"running\" to \"run\" but \"was\" to \"be\".
