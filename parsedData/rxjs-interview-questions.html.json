It is unacceptable for the component under stress to fail or to drop messages in an uncontrolled fashion. Since it is not easy to handle and can't fail, it should communicate that it is under stress to upstream components and get them to reduce the load. This back-pressure is an important feedback mechanism that facilitates systems to respond to load rather than collapse under such a situation gracefully. The back-pressure may cascade up to the user, at which point responsiveness may degrade. Still, this mechanism will ensure that the system is resilient under load and will provide information that may allow the system to apply other resources to make easy the load by distributing it. ","result":"In a complex system, if one component is struggling to keep up, it can result in the entire system being impacted. It is crucial in such a scenario that the component under stress does not fail or lose information in an uncontrolled manner. Instead, the component should communicate to other upstream components that it is under stress and request them to reduce the load.
