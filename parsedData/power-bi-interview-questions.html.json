KPI is also used to help you to evaluate the analysis performances with their graphical representation and specifies if your goals have been met or not.  ","result":"KPIs, or Key Performance Indicators, are metrics used to assess an organization's success in different areas by analyzing measurable objectives and values. They involve measuring a base value against target values and comparing achieved performance with the target. KPIs offer graphical representations to aid in analyzing performance and determine if targets were met."},{"tag":"p","original":" Generally, the Distinct() and Values() functions are the same in Power BI. The only difference between them is that the Values() function don't calculate null values, whereas the Distinct() function calculates even the null values.
