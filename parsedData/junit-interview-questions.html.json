","result":"In order to evaluate a protected method, the test class must belong to the same package as the class being tested."},{"tag":"p","original":" There is no direct way for testing of the private method; hence manual testing is to be performed, or the method is changed to \"protected\" method. ","result":"It is not possible to perform direct testing of a private method. In such cases, manual testing is the only way or alternatively, the method could be modified to a \"protected\" method."},{"tag":"p","original":" JUnit test methods are designed to return 'void'. So the execution will fail. ","result":"It is not possible to have a JUnit test method that returns a value other than 'void'. This means that if a test method returns anything, the execution of the code will fail."},{"tag":"p","original":" Junit extension class, XMLTestCase and set of supporting classes is provided by the XMLUnit. ","result":"XMLUnit provides a JUnit extension class, as well as an XMLTestCase and several related classes, for testing XML documents."},{"tag":"p","original":" A Unit Test Case is the combination of input data and expected output result. It is defined to test the functionality of a unit. ","result":"A Unit Test Case is a critical tool utilized to ensure the proper and expected behavior of a unit. It consists of input data and anticipated output results, and serves to test the functionality of the unit under examination."},{"tag":"p","original":" The @Test annotation is used to mark the method as the test method. ","result":"The @Test annotation is a way to indicate that a specific method is being used as a test method. It serves as a marker that the method is intended to carry out testing."},{"tag":"p","original":" The test suit allows us to group multiple test cases so that it can be run together. TestSuit is the container class under junit.framework.TestSuite package. ","result":"The TestSuite class in the junit.framework.TestSuite package is used as a container for grouping together multiple test cases to be run simultaneously."},{"tag":"p","original":" The test runner is used to execute the test cases.
