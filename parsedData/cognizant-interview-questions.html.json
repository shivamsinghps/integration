Inheritance allows for the reuse of code and simplifies the programming process."},{"tag":"p","original":" A constructor is a method which is used to initialize a newly created object and is called just after when memory allocated to the object. It can be used to implement the objects to desired values or default values at the time of object creation. ","result":"A constructor is a special method that is used to set the initial state of a newly instantiated object. It is called immediately after the object is created in memory and can be used to assign values to the object's properties or set default values. In essence, constructors are used to prepare an object for use."},{"tag":"p","original":" A destructor used when the initialized object is destructing it called automatically during the destruction of an object. It helps in recovering the heap space and remove files. ","result":"A destructor is a function that is automatically invoked during the deletion of a created object. It is crucial in freeing up memory space allocated to objects and removing files associated with them."},{"tag":"p","original":" Data Structure is a process in which management or organization of data that enable a more efficient way to organize the data. ","result":"A data structure refers to the method of arranging or managing data, allowing for a more streamlined approach to organizing data."},{"tag":"p","original":" A linked list is a set of ordered data and each of its previous nodes connected to its succeeding node. It is like an array but more efficient then array because we can insert or delete data in between the nodes. ","result":"A linked list is a collection of data arranged in a specific order, where each node in the list is connected to its adjacent node. This data structure bears resemblance to an array but offers more efficiency due to its ability to insert and delete data in between the nodes."},{"tag":"p","original":" Yes, because it also handles the data in a structured way. ","result":"Certainly, here's a rephrased version: \n\nIndeed, a database management system enables structured handling of data, which is why it is important for managing large volumes of data."},{"tag":"p","original":" It is also known as ordered or sorted binary tree. It keeps there nodes or keys in sort form, and the root node of BST is bigger than the left node and smaller than the right node. ","result":"A binary search tree (BST), also known as an ordered or sorted binary tree, organizes its nodes or keys in a sorted manner. The root node of the BST is larger than its left node and smaller than its right node, maintaining the sorted order of the tree."},{"tag":"p","original":" A binary tree is part of a data structure that has two sub-nodes, a right node, and a left node. In programming, binary trees are an advanced version of the linked list. ","result":"A binary tree is a type of data structure that consists of two sub-nodes: a left node and a right node. In programming, binary trees are considered more advanced than simple linked lists. They can be implemented using various programming languages and are used to store and organize large amounts of data efficiently."},{"tag":"p","original":" Pushing and popping applies to the way data is stored and fetched from a stack. A push method denotes data being added to it, meaning information is being \"pushed\" in the stack. On the other hand, a pop method denotes data retrieval/fetch, and in particular, refers to the first data is being fetched. ","result":"This content describes the concepts of pushing and popping in relation to how data is stored and retrieved from a stack. The push method adds data to the stack, while the pop method retrieves data from the stack, starting with the first item."},{"tag":"p","original":" A stack base on LIFO pattern. It means that data access follows a sequential process wherein the last data to be entered when the first one deleted. Arrays do not follow a particular order and instead can access by referring to the indexed element within the array. ","result":"A stack operates on the principle of LIFO (last in, first out), where the most recently added data is the first to be removed. On the other hand, arrays are not ordered in a particular sequence and elements can be accessed by their index within the array."},{"tag":"p","original":" Doubly linked lists are a particular part of linked list wherein traversal across the data elements can be done in any directions. This is possible by having two links in every node, one that connects to the next node and another one that links to the previous node. ","result":"Doubly linked lists are a type of linked list that allows traversal in both forward and backward directions. Each node in this type of list contains two links - one to connect to the next node and the other to link to the previous node. This unique feature of having two links enables smooth traversal in either direction."},{"tag":"p","original":" A Queue is a data structure which is linear and follows a fixed order in which the operations occur. The order is always First In First Out (FIFO). An excellent example of a queue is any queue of the customer for a resource where the customer that came first served first. The difference between stacks and queues is while deleting. ","result":"A Queue is a type of data structure that works on a linear ordering system where the earliest operation is performed first. This is commonly known as First In First Out (FIFO). A classic example of a queue is a customer queue for any service where the first person in line is served first. While deleting data, the fundamental distinction between queues and stacks is how they operate."},{"tag":"p","original":" Basic features of Stack are an ordered list of the similar data type. The stack is LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure, or we can say FILO (First In Last Out) data structure. Push () method is used to insert/enter new elements into the Stack and pop() method is used to remove/delete an element from the stack. ","result":"The Stack is a data structure that involves an ordered collection of elements of the same data type. It follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out) approach. To add elements, the Push() method is used, while to remove elements, the Pop() method is used."},{"tag":"p","original":" A graph shows a representation of a set of objects/nodes where some pairs of object/nodes are connected by links/connection. The interconnection of objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges. ","result":"A graph is a visual representation of objects or nodes that are connected by links or edges. The nodes are represented by points in the graph, while the links connecting the nodes are represented by the lines."},{"tag":"p","original":" A priority queue is an abstracted data type which is like a queue or stack data structure, but where additionally each element has a \"priority\" associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. ","result":"A type of data structure called a priority queue exists to manage elements with different levels of importance, prioritizing high priority ones over low priority ones for processing. It resembles a queue or stack structure but includes a priority factor associated with each element."},{"tag":"p","original":" The time complexity of insertion/deletion in a singly linked list depends upon the position where you want to perform them. For example, if you want to insert an element at the end of the linked list, then you have to traverse/travel the entire list, and hence the complexity will be O(n). ","result":"The efficiency of inserting or deleting an element in a singly linked list is determined by its location within the list. For instance, if you intend to add an element at the end of the list, you must traverse the entire list, resulting in a time complexity of O(n)."},{"tag":"p","original":" This code below is written in Java.
