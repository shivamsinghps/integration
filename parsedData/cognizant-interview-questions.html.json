","result":"A doubly linked list is a type of linked list that enables traversal between data elements in both forward and backward directions. This is achieved through the use of two links in each node, one that connects to the next node and another that connects to the previous node."},{"tag":"p","original":" A Queue is a data structure which is linear and follows a fixed order in which the operations occur. The order is always First In First Out (FIFO). An excellent example of a queue is any queue of the customer for a resource where the customer that came first served first. The difference between stacks and queues is while deleting. ","result":"A queue is a type of data structure that is linear in nature and operates on a fixed order. It follows the rule of First In First Out (FIFO), meaning the first item added to the queue will be the first one to get processed. One common example of a queue is the line of people waiting for customer service, where the first person to arrive will be the first one to be attended to. It is important to note that stacks and queues differ in terms of their deletion process."},{"tag":"p","original":" Basic features of Stack are an ordered list of the similar data type. The stack is LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure, or we can say FILO (First In Last Out) data structure. Push () method is used to insert/enter new elements into the Stack and pop() method is used to remove/delete an element from the stack. ","result":"The Stack is a data structure that comprises an organized list of elements of the same data type. It adheres to the principle of LIFO (Last In, First Out) or FILO (First In, Last Out). To add new elements, the push() method is used, while to remove elements, the pop() method is used."},{"tag":"p","original":" A graph shows a representation of a set of objects/nodes where some pairs of object/nodes are connected by links/connection. The interconnection of objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges. ","result":"A graph is a visual representation of a group of objects or nodes that are connected by links or connections. The nodes are represented by vertices, while the links that connect them are known as edges."},{"tag":"p","original":" A priority queue is an abstracted data type which is like a queue or stack data structure, but where additionally each element has a \"priority\" associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. ","result":"A priority queue is a specialized kind of data type that includes a \"priority\" attribute attached to each element. While sharing similarities with queues and stacks, priority queues give priority to elements with higher priority values over those with lower values."},{"tag":"p","original":" The time complexity of insertion/deletion in a singly linked list depends upon the position where you want to perform them. For example, if you want to insert an element at the end of the linked list, then you have to traverse/travel the entire list, and hence the complexity will be O(n). ","result":"The efficiency of inserting or deleting elements in a singly linked list is determined by the location where it is performed. If the insertion or deletion happens at the end of the list, then it would require traversing the entire linked list, thus making the time complexity O(n)."},{"tag":"p","original":" This code below is written in Java.
