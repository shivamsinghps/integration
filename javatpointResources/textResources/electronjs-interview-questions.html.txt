h3 => [ 10) What are the different types of processes in the Electron? ]
p => [ There are two types of processes in the Electron: Main and Renderer. ]
p => [  Main process:  Some modules work on each or in both of the processes. The main process is more behind-the-scenes. It is chargeable for interacting with the native graphical consumer interface (GUI) of the working machine. ]
p => [  Renderer process:  The Renderer process is answerable for jogging the personal interface of your application via the usage of HTML files, CSS files, JavaScript files and so on. The renderer process runs in each of the windows in your app. ]
h3 => [ 11) What is the Inter-Process Communication module in Electron? ]
p => [ Inter-Process Communication module is a mechanism which lets in exchange of synchronous and asynchronous messages between main and renderer process in Electron.  ]

p => [ A User Interface in Electron can be built by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  ]
h3 => [ 13) What Are Environment Variables In Electron? ]
p => [ Environment variables are used to control application configuration and behavior without changing code. Environment variables control some Electron behaviors because they are initialized earlier than the command-line flags and the app's code. ]
p => [ There are two types of environment variables in Electron. ]
li => [ Production variable ]
li => [ Development variable ]
h3 => [ 14) What do you understand by Web View in Electron? ]
p => [ In Electron, WebView is a tag that is used to embed web pages. It runs in a separate system and interacts asynchronously between an app and embedded content material.  ]

p => [ In an Electron browser window, the DevTools is the only debug JavaScript executed in those web pages. It uses an external debugger and launches Electron with commands -debug or -debug-brk, -inspect or inspect-brk. ]
p => [ Chrome Devtools is used for the debugging renderer process as it is executed in the browser window. ]
h3 => [ 18) Is the Electron secure to use? ]
p => [ Electron applications are web applications run in the Chromium engine so, they may be vulnerable to web-related attacks such as cross-site scripting attacks, through the same attack vectors as a browser (e.g., Chromium) or other internal components (Node.js) if you use the older versions of Electron. These vulnerabilities have been fixed in the latest Electron releases. ]
