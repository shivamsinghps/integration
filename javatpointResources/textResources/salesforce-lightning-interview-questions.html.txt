p => [  Application Event:  The scope of the application event is throughout the lightning App. It sends a notification if any component is registered for this event. ]
p => [  Component Event:  The scope of this event is within itself or the parent component of this event. It sends a notification for all the components declared within the parent component. ]
p => [  System Event:  This type of event is fired by Salesforce's system during the lifecycle of the lightning app. ]
h3 => [ 16) What do you understand by aura definition bundle? ]
p => [ An aura definition bundle is a specific type of bundle that contains an Aura definition and its related resources. This may be a component, application, event, interface, or a tokens collection. The AuraDefinitionBundle component is a folder that contains definition files. This is not a single file like most other metadata components. Instead, it is a collection of files. Each file represents a resource in a bundle, such as a markup, applications, code files (including controllers and helpers), events, documentation, and interfaces. ]
p => [ An aura definition bundle does not have a suffix. The definition files can have one of the following suffixes: ]
th => [ Suffix ]

td => [ .tokens ]
td => [ Tokens collection ]
h3 => [ 17) What is Lightning out? ]
p => [ Lightning out is a process that is used when we want to use our component on the external site. The biggest advantage of lightning out is utilizing lightning components in a visual force page. ]
h3 => [ 18) What are the key differences between Component Event and Application Event? ]
p => [ Following is the list of key differences between Component Event and Application Event: ]
th => [ Component Event ]
th => [ Application Event ]
td => [ Component events are used for communication between child and parent. ]
td => [ Application events are used to communicate any changes in the component to a broader audience. ]
td => [ Component events use bubbling and capture same as used in DOM events. If you make any changes in a child component, it will be communicated to the parent component via component event. ]
td => [ If a component is registered for this event in application events, it will get notified. ]
td => [ Component events can only be handled by components above them in the containment hierarchy. That's why their usage is localized to the components that need to know about them. ]
td => [ Application events are best suitable for things that should be handled at the application level, such as navigating to a specific record. Application events also allow communication between components in separate application parts and have no direct containment relationship. ]
h3 => [ 19) What are the different types of Lightning Record pages, and how can we build them? ]
p => [ There are mainly three types of Lightning Record pages: ]
li => [ Record page ]
li => [ App page ]
li => [ Home page  ]
p => [ We can create or build Lightning Record pages by using Lightning App Builder. ]
h3 => [ 20) What is the use of implements in the lightning component? What are the different interfaces implemented in the lightning component? ]
p => [ Implements are used to refer to platform interfaces that make components able to be used in different contexts or to grant access to extra context data. A component can implement more than one interface. ]

h3 => [ 23) What is Locker service in Salesforce lightning? ]
p => [ In Salesforce lightning, the Locker service is robust security architecture for the lightning components. This service is used to improve and enhance security by isolating the lightning components which belong to the namespace from the components in the distinct namespace. Locker service follows some practices that enhance the code's maintainability by providing access to the supported APIs. ]
h3 => [ 24) How can we use a lightning component in the VisualForce Page? ]
p => [ We can embed the lightning component on the VisualForce page by using Lightning out. We should follow the following three steps to add the lightning component to the VisualForce page: ]
li => [ First, we must insert the lightning components for the JavaScript library of visual force to our intent visual force page through the tag. ]
li => [ Now, we can generate and point a lightning app that we use for the component dependencies. ]
li => [ At last, we have to write a JavaScript function that creates the component over the page through $ Lightning.createComponent(). ]
h3 => [ 25) What is FlexiPage in Salesforce Lightning? ]
p => [ FlexiPage is the metadata related to a lightning page. The lightning page specifies an adaptive screen that has several lightning components. It contains 25 components. FlexiPages are stored as XML files and deployed through a deployment tool or metadata API. These lightning pages are referred to as Flexipages in the API. ]
h3 => [ 26) Are Lightning Components only directed towards mobile apps? ]
p => [ The Lightning Components are mainly designed with a mobile-first approach, but they have a responsive design that allows them to give the same experience even over the desktop without writing any separate lines of code. ]
h3 => [ 27) What do you understand by Lightning:navigation? ]
p => [ The Lightning:navigation is used to navigate to a page reference or create a URL from the given page Reference. We have to define the page reference object for navigating. The page reference is the JavaScript object which references a page, offering a defined structure that explains the type of page and its respective values. ]
strong => [ It facilitates us to navigate to the following supported features: ]
li => [ Lightning Component ]
li => [ Web Page ]
li => [ Object Page ]
li => [ Record Page ]
li => [ Named Page ]

li => [ Default Phase ]
li => [ Bubble Phase ]
h3 => [ 32) What is the use of Lightning:recordEditForm? ]
p => [ In the Lightning:recordEditForm, the Lightning:inputField is used for creating the editable fields. Using the Lightning:output field, we can display the read-only information. ]
strong => [ The Lightning:recordEditForm contains the following features: ]
li => [ It displays the record edit layout to edit a particular record. ]
li => [ It can also display the record to create the layout to create a particular record. ]
h3 => [ 33) Can we make a Lightning Component that can be used in the mobile and desktop user interfaces? ]
p => [ Yes, we can make a Lightning Component that can be used in the mobile and desktop user interfaces. The Lightning Component specifies an extremely fast experience that is responsive and ready by default and has compatibility in Salesforce1 App. Its responsive nature makes it adjust as per the resolution of the screen size. So, we can use it easily on the desktop without any separate code. ]
h3 => [ 34) How can we add Aura components to our Visualforce page? ]
p => [ There are the following three ways that a developer can choose to add the Aura components to the Visualforce page: ]
li => [ A developer can create a reference to a Lightning app for declaring the component dependencies. ]
li => [ Use the &lt;apex:includeLightning/&gt; component and add the Lightning component for the Visualforce JavaScript library used in your Visualforce page. ]
li => [ Use the $Lightning.createComponent() to create the component for a page by writing a JavaScript function. ]
h3 => [ 35) What is the difference between &lt;ui:input&gt; and &lt;lightning:input&gt;? ]
p => [ The main difference between &lt;ui:input&gt; and &lt;lightning:input&gt;: ]
li => [ &lt;ui:input&gt;: It does not contain lightning design system styling. ]
li => [ &lt;lightning:input&gt;: It contains lightning design system styling. ]
h3 => [ 36) What is the usage of Aura: method Tag in Lightning? ]
p => [ The Aura: method tag is mainly used to define component API. After using this tag, we don't need to fire and handle a component event, and it allows us to directly invoke the method in the component's controller on the client-side. It simplifies the code required for a parent component to call a method on a child component that forms a part of the parent component. ]
h3 => [ 37) Is it possible to create one component for inheriting style/CSS from the parent component, or do we always need to define it in the Salesforce component? ]
p => [ It is completely possible to create one component for inheriting style/CSS from the parent component. We can inherit styles from parents, and it is not necessary to always define them in the Salesforce component. ]
h3 => [ 38) What do you understand by an Action provider and a Value provider? ]
p => [ An Action provider facilitates us to manage the events, actions, and handlers for the component. On the other hand, a Value provider facilitates us to use the component attribute's value in the component JavaScript and markup controller. ]
h3 => [ 39) Is it possible to include external JavaScript/CSS libraries like jQuery, bootstrap in components? ]
p => [ Yes, it is possible to include multiple external JavaScript/CSS libraries like JQuery, Bootstrap, custom CSS, and custom JavaScript libraries in our lightning component using a static resource. ]
h3 => [ 40) How can we get the current record id in the lightning component? ]
p => [  To get the current record id in the lightning component, we have to add the  force:hasRecordId  interface to a Lightning component. It makes the component able to assign the ID of the current record. The current record ID is useful if the component is used on a Lightning record page as an object-specific custom action or action override in Lightning Experience or the Salesforce app. This interface doesn't show any effect except when used within Lightning Experience, the Salesforce mobile app, and template-based communities. ]
h3 => [ 41) What do you understand by Scratch org? ]
p => [ The Scratch org is an expandable Salesforce org used for testing and development. The Scratch org can be created for 30 days, after which we deactivate the Scratch org. The by default duration of Scratch org is seven days. ]
h3 => [ 42) What is the use of popup in the lightning component? ]
p => [ Popup or Modals Boxes display content in a layer above the app. This paradigm is mainly used in cases such as creating or editing a record and various types of messaging and wizards. ]
h3 => [ 43) What is the purpose of the force:appHostable interface in the Salesforce lightning component? ]
p => [ The force:appHostable interface is used as a custom tab in the Salesforce lightning component or mobile app. ]
h3 => [ 44) How can we define the field-level security in the Salesforce lightning components? ]
p => [ We can use the Lightning:recordEditForm, force: record data, and Lightning: record form to define the field level security. ]
h3 => [ 45) What are the different global value providers in Salesforce lightning? ]
p => [ Following are the different global value providers in Salesforce lightning: ]
li => [ $globalID ]
li => [ $Label ]
li => [ $Locale ]
li => [ $Browser ]
li => [ $Resource ]
h3 => [ 46) How can we display the loading spinner in the lightning component? ]
p => [  Loading spinners are the CSS indicators we can display while retrieving the data or performing slow calculations. We can use  Lightning:spinner  that shows the animated spinner image indicating that a request is loading. ]
h3 => [ 47: How do the capture phase and bubble phase propagate? ]
p => [ The capture phase propagates from top to bottom while the bubble phase propagates from bottom to top. ]
