p => [ A search engine is a web-based software program that is developed to search and find information on the World Wide Web. It enables internet users to search the information via the World Wide Web (WWW). The user is required to enter keywords or phrases into the search engines and then search engine searches websites, web pages or documents containing the similar keywords and presents a list of web pages with same keywords in the search engine result pages.  ]

h3 => [ 11) How does a search engine work? ]
p => [ To understand, how a search engine works, we can divide the work of search engines into three different stages: crawling, indexing, and retrieval. ]
p => [  Crawling : It is performed by software robots called web spiders or web crawlers. Each search engine has its web spiders to perform crawling. In this step, the spiders visit websites or web pages and read them and follow the links to other web pages of the site. Thus by crawling, they can find out what is published on the World Wide Web. Once the crawler visits a page, it makes a copy of that page and adds its URL to the index. ]
p => [ The web spider generally starts crawling with heavily used servers and popular web pages. It follows the route determined by the link structure and finds new interconnected documents through new links. It also revisits the previous sites to check for the changes or updates in the web pages. If changes are found, it makes a copy of the changes to update the index.  ]
p => [  Indexing : It involves building an index after crawling all websites or web pages found on the World Wide Web. An index of the crawled sites is made based on the type and quality of information provided by them and stored in huge storage facilities. It is like a book that contains a copy of each webpage crawled by the spider. Thus, it collects and organizes the information from all over the internet. ]
p => [  Retrieval : In this step, the search engine responds to the search queries made by the users by providing a list of websites with relevant answers or information in a particular order. It keeps the relevant websites, which offer unique and original information, on the top of the search engine result pages. So, whenever, a user performs an online search, the search engine searches its database for the websites or web pages with relevant information and make a list of these sites based on their relevancy and present this list to the users on the search engine result pages. ]
h3 => [ 12) What is the usage of an anchor tag in SEO? ]
p => [ The anchor tag is used to make click-able text written on a hyperlink, i.e., it is a clickable text in a hyperlink. It enhances the user experience as it takes the users directly to a specific area of a webpage. They are not required to scroll down the information to find a particular section. So, it is a way to improve navigation.  ]
p => [ It also enables webmasters to keep things in order as there is no need of creating different web pages or splitting up a document. Google also sends users to a specific part of your page using this tag. You can attach anchor tag to a word or a phrase. It takes the reader down to a different section of the page instead of another page. When you use this tag, you create a unique URL on the same page. ]

p => [ Page title, H1, Body text or content, Meta title, Meta description, Anchor links and Image Alt Tags are some of the most important areas where we can include our keywords for the SEO purpose. ]

If you use GWT, you don't need to use some other costlier tools. So, it is a free toolset that helps you understand what is going on with your site by providing useful information about your site. ]
h3 => [ 17) What do you mean by Spider? ]
p => [ Many search engines use programs called spiders to index websites. The spiders are also known as crawlers or robots. They act as automatic date searching tools that visit every site to find new or updated web pages and links. This process is called web crawling. Spiders follow hyperlinks and gather textual and meta information for the search engine databases. They collect as much information as they can before relaying to the server of the search engine.  ]
p => [ Spiders may also rate the content being indexed to help the search engine determine relevancy levels to a search. They are called spiders as they visit many sites simultaneously, i.e. their legs keep spanning a large area of the web. All search engines use spiders to revise and build their indexes. ]
h3 => [ 18) What are Meta Tags? ]
p => [  Meta tags are the HTML tags that are used to provide information about the content of a webpage. They are the basic elements of SEO. Meta tags are incorporated in the "head" section of HTML, e.g.  &lt;head&gt;Meta tags are placed here&lt;/head&gt; . ]

p => [ A title tag is an HTML element that is used to specify the title of a page. It is displayed on search engine result pages as a clickable heading just above the URL and at the top of the browser.  ]
p => [ In SEO, the title tag is significant. It is highly recommended to include a unique and relevant title that correctly describes the content of a webpage or a website. Thus, it tells the users and search engines about the nature or type of information contained in your webpage.  ]
p => [ An ideal title should be between 50 and 60 characters long. You can also place your primary keywords at the start of your title and put the least important keywords at the end. It is the first thing that a search engine analyzes before ranking your webpage. ]
h3 => [ 20) Does Google use the keyword meta tags? ]
p => [ No, Google does not use the keyword meta tags in web search rankings. It is believed that Google ignores the meta tags keywords due to their misuse. ]
h3 => [ 21) What is cloaking? ]
p => [ Cloaking is a black hat SEO technique that enables you to create two different pages. One page is designed for the users, and the other is created for the search engine crawlers. It is used to present different information to the user than what is presented to the crawlers. Cloaking is against the guidelines of Google, as it provides users with different information than they expected. So, it should not be used to improve the SEO of your site. ]
p => [ Some Examples of Cloaking: ]
li => [ Presenting a page of HTML text to search engines and showing a page of images or flash to visitors ]
li => [ Including text or keywords into a page only when it is requested by the search engine, not by a human visitor  ]
h3 => [ 22) Is HTML case-sensitive or case-insensitive? ]
p => [ HTML is a case-insensitive language because uppercase or lowercase does not matter in this language and you can write your code in any case. However, HTML coding is generally written in lower case. ]

h3 => [ 29) When is reinclusion applied in a search engine's index? ]
p => [ If your website is banned by the search engines for using black hat practices and you have corrected the wrongdoings, you can apply for reinclusion.

Google, Yahoo, and other search engines offer tools where webmasters can submit their site for reinclusion. ]
h3 => [ 30) What is robot.txt? ]
p => [ Robots.txt is a text file that gives instructions to the search engine crawlers about the indexing of a webpage, domain, directory or a file of a website. It is generally used to tell spiders about the pages that you don't want to be crawled. It is not mandatory for search engines, yet search engine spiders follow the instructions of the robots.txt.  ]
p => [ The location of this file is very significant. It must be located in the main directory otherwise the spiders will not be able to find it as they do not search the whole site for a file named robots.txt. They only check the main directory for these files, and if they don't find the files in the main directory, they assume that the site does not have any robots.txt file and index the whole site. ]
h3 => [ 31) What is keyword proximity? ]
p => [ Keyword proximity refers to the distance between the keywords, i.e., it tells how close keywords are to each other in a phrase or body of text. It is used to measure the distance between two keywords in the text. It is used by some search engines to measure the relevancy of a given page to the search request. It specifies that the closer the two keywords in a phrase or a search term, the more relevant will be the phrase. For example, see the keywords "Delhi Digital Photographer" in the search term "Delhi Photographer Ram Kumar specialized in digital photography." The proximity between Delhi and Photographer is excellent, but between the "Photographer" and "digital" proximity is not good as there are four words between them. So, a search term's keywords should be as close to each other as possible. ]
h3 => [ 32) What is an URL? ]
p => [  URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator (URL). It is the web address of an online resource like a website, webpage or a document on the internet. It tells the location and name of the resource as well as the protocol used to access it, i.e., it locates an existing resource on the internet.

p => [ A domain is displayed on the address bar of the web browser and may consist of any combination of letters and numbers and can be used with various domain name extensions such as .com, .net and more. Domain name is always unique, i.e., no two websites can have the same domain name. ]

It is based on the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes, which means it can have only two characters, e.g., .us for the United States, .au for Australia, .in for India. So these domain extensions are reserved for countries. See the image given below: ]
h3 => [ 37) What is an internal link? ]
p => [ An internal link is a URL link placed on your website that points to your another webpage. It is different from an external link which leads to another website. Internal links are very useful regarding SEO as they: ]
strong => [ Provide site structure ]
strong => [ Enhance user experience ]
strong => [ Minimize bounce rate ]
h3 => [ 38) Why are backlinks important? ]
p => [ The backlinks are an indication of the popularity of a website. They are important for SEO as most of the search engines like Google give more value to websites that have a large number of quality backlinks, i.e., a site with more backlinks is considered more relevant than a site with fewer backlinks. ]
p => [ The backlinks should be relevant which means they should come from the sites that have content related to your site or pages otherwise the links if they are coming from sites that have different content, will be treated as irrelevant backlinks by the Search Engine. For example, there is a website about how to rescue orphaned dogs, and it receives a backlink from a website about dog care essentials then this would be a relevant backlink in a search engine assessment than a like from site about automobiles. ]
h3 => [ 39) What is the difference between an inbound link and an outbound link in SEO? ]
p => [ An inbound link, which is also known as a backlink, is the incoming link to your site from an external source. It comes from an external site to your site. Whereas, outbound link is a link that starts from your site and points to another website. For example, if xyz.com links to your domain, this link from xyz.com is an inbound or backlink for your domain. However, it is an outbound link for xyz.com. See the image given below: ]
h3 => [ 40) What is link popularity? ]
p => [ Link popularity refers to the number of backlinks that point towards a website. The backlinks can be of two types: internal and external links. The links to a website from its pages are called internal links and the links from outside sources or other websites are called external links. ]
p => [ The high link popularity indicates that more people are connected to your site, and it has relevant information. Most of the search engines use link popularity in its algorithm while ranking websites in the SERPs. For example, if two websites have the same level of SEO, the site with higher link popularity will be higher than another site by the search engine. ]
h3 => [ 41) What are contextual backlinks? ]
p => [ Contextual backlinks are the links to external websites that are placed within the content of a web page, i.e., they are part of the content of a page. They are generally built from high authority web pages. These links can be used to build your keyword ranking higher in Search Engines and to increase the domain trust online. See the image: ]
h3 => [ 42) What do you understand by crawling? ]
p => [ Crawling refers to an automated process that enables search engines to visit web pages and gather URLs for indexing. When the crawler visits a page, it makes a copy of that page and adds its URL to the index which is called indexing. The search engines have software robots, which are known as web spiders or web crawlers, for crawling. ]
p => [ The crawler not only reads the pages but also follows the internal and external links. Thus, they can find out what is published on the World Wide Web. The crawlers also revisit the previous sites to check for the changes or updates in their web pages. If changes are found, it updates the index accordingly. ]
h3 => [ 43) What is indexing? ]
p => [ Indexing starts after crawling. It is a process of building an index by adding URLs of web pages crawled by the crawlers. An index is a place where all the data that has been crawled is stored, i.e., it is like a huge book with a copy of each page that is crawled. Whenever users enter search queries, it is the index that provides the results for search queries within seconds. Without an index, it won't be possible for a search engine to render search results so fast. ]
p => [ So, the index is made of URLs of different web pages visited by the crawler. The information contained in the web pages is provided by the search engines to users for their queries. If a page is not added to the index, it can't be viewed by the users. ]
h3 => [ 44) What is the World Wide Web? ]
p => [ The World Wide Web is a like a huge book whose pages are located on multiple servers present throughout the world. These web pages contain information and are connected by links called "hypertext." In a book, we move from one page to another in a sequence, but in World Wide Web, we have to follow hypertext links to visit the desired page. ]
p => [ So, it is a network of internet servers containing information in the form of web pages, audios, videos, etc. These web pages are formatted in HTML and accessed via HTTP.  ]
p => [ World Wide Web was designed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. It is different from the internet which is a network connection used to access the World Wide Web. ]
h3 => [ 45) What is a website or what do you understand by a website? ]
p => [ A website is a collection of interlinked web pages or formatted documents that share a single domain and can be accessed over the internet. It may contain only one page or tens of thousands of pages and can be created by an individual, group, or an organization, etc. It is identified by a domain name or web address. For example, when you type the web address over the internet, you will arrive at the home page of that website. ]
h3 => [ 46) What is a web page? ]
p => [ A web page is what you see on the screen of a computer or mobile when you type a web address or click on a link or enter a query in a search engine like Google, Bing, etc. A web page typically contains information that may include text, graphics, images, animation, sound, video, etc. See the image given below: ]
h3 => [ 47) What is a web server? ]
p => [ It is a computer program that is designed to serve or deliver the web pages to users in response to their queries or requests made by their computers or HTTP clients. In other words, it hosts websites on the internet. It uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve pages to computers that are connected to it. See the image given below for more clarification! ]
h3 => [ 48) What is Web Hosting? ]
p => [ A service that provides space for websites or web pages on special computers called servers. A web hosting enables sites or web pages to be viewed on the internet by the internet users. When users type the website address (domain name) into their browser, their computers connect to the server, and your web pages are delivered to them through a browser. ]
p => [ The websites are stored and hosted on special computers called servers. So, if you want users to see your website, you are required to publish it with a web hosting service. It is generally measured in terms of disc space you are allotted on the server and the bandwidth you require for accessing the server. While choosing a web hosting services one should evaluate the reliability and customer service of the service provider. ]
h3 => [ 49) What are organic results? ]
p => [ Organic results refer to the listings of web pages on the SERPs that appear because of organic SEO such as relevance to the search term or keywords and free white hat SEO techniques. They are also known as free or natural results. The search engine marketing (SEM) is not involved in producing organic results. So, organic results are the natural way of getting top ranking in SERP. The main purpose of SEO is to get a higher ranking for a web page in organic results of the search engines. ]
h3 => [ 50) What are the paid results? ]
p => [ Paid search results are the sponsored ads or links that appear on the SERPs. They are part of Search Engine Marketing in which you have to pay to place your websites or ads on the top of the result pages. The website owners who have a good budget and want results quickly generally pay to Google to display their websites on the top of the result pages for the specific search terms or keywords. ]
h3 => [ 51) What is a Canonical URL or Tag? ]
p => [ Canonical URL, which is also known as a canonical tag, is an HTML element that is used to prevent duplicate content issues. This tag is used when multiple versions of the same page are available over the internet. ]
p => [ It enables you to select the best URL as a canonical URL out of the several URLs of the multiple copies of a webpage. When you mark one version or copy as canonical version, the other versions are considered the variations of the canonical or original version by the search engine. Thus, it is used to resolve content duplication issues. ]
p => [  In this image, we have marked the URL of the page " www.example.com/toys/cars/yellow  "as canonical URL. So, Google will consider it the original page and the other two pages as its variations, not the duplicates. ]
h3 => [ 52) What is Meta description? ]
p => [ Meta descriptions, which are also known as HTML attributes, provide brief information about the content of a web page. They act as preview snippets of the web pages and appear under the URL of your page in SERPs. ]
