h1 => [ R Interview Questions ]
p => [  A list of frequently asked  R Interview Questions and answers  are given below. ]
h3 => [ 1) What is R? ]
p => [ R is an interpreted computer programming language which was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand". It is a software environment used to analyze statistical information, graphical representation, reporting, and data modeling. R is the implementation of the S programming language, which is combined with lexical scoping semantics. ]
h3 => [ 2) Differentiate between vector, List, Matrix, and Data frame. ]
p => [  A  vector  is a series of data elements of the same basic type. The members in the vector are known as a component. ]
p => [  The R object that contains elements of different types such as numbers, strings, vectors, or another list inside it, is known as  List . ]
p => [  A two-dimensional data structure used to bind the vectors from the same length, known as the  matrix . The matrix contains the same types of elements. ]
p => [  A  Data  frame is a generic form of a matrix. It is a combination of lists and matrices. In the Data frame, different data columns contain different data types. ]
