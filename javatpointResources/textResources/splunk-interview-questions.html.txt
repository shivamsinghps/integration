h3 => [ 27) What is the use of Transaction and Stats commands in Splunk? ]
p => [ In Splunk, transaction, and stats, both commands are used for different purposes. The transaction command is mostly used in two specific cases: ]
li => [ The transaction command is used when the unique ID (from one or more fields) alone is not sufficient to discriminate between two transactions. In this case, we have to reuse the identifier. When we have to reuse the identifier, for example, in DHCP logs, a particular message is used to identify the beginning or end of a transaction. For example, web sessions are identified by a cookie/client IP. In this case, the time or pauses are also used to segment the data into transactions. ]
li => [ It is also used when we want to see the raw text of events combined rather than an analysis of the constituent fields of the events. ]
p => [ In other cases, it is preferred to use stats commands. The performance of the stats command is higher, so it is best suited for distributed search environment. We can also use the stats command in the case of a unique ID. ]
h3 => [ 28) What are some important configuration files used in Splunk? ]
p => [ Some important and most commonly used Splunk configuration files are: ]
li => [ Inputs file ]
li => [ Transforms file ]

strong => [ Hot Bucket: ]
strong => [ Warm Bucket: ]
strong => [ Cold Bucket: ]
strong => [ Frozen Bucket: ]
h3 => [ 30) What is the difference between Index time and Search time? ]
p => [ In Splunk, the index time is a period when the data is consumed and the point when it is written to disk. On the other hand, search time occurs when the search is run as events are composed by the search. ]
h3 => [ 31) What is the difference between stats and eventstats commands? ]
p => [  Stats Command:  The stats command generates summary statistics of all the existing fields in the search results. After generating summary statistics, it saves them as values in new fields. ]
p => [  Eventstats:  Eventstats is similar to the stats command, but it aggregates results and adds inline to each event if the aggregation is pertinent to that event. The eventstats command computes the requested statistics, like the stats command does, but aggregates them to the original raw data. ]
h3 => [ 32) How can you reset the Splunk administrator password? ]
