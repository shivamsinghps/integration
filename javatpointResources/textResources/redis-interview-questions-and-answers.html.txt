h1 => [ Redis Interview Questions ]
p => [  A list of frequently asked  Redis interview questions  and answers are given below. ]
h3 => [ 1) What is Redis? ]
p => [ Redis is an open-source, advance key value data store and cache. It is also referred as a data structure server which keys not only contains strings, but also hashes, sets, lists, and sorted sets. ]
h3 => [ 2) What is the meaning of Redis? ]
p => [ Redis stands for REmote DIctionary Server. ]
h3 => [ 3) How is Redis different from other databases? ]
p => [ Redis is a NoSQL, Opensource, in-memory data-structure store. It follows the principle of key-value store. ]
p => [ It is extremely fast, persistent, portable and supports many languages such as C, C++, C#, Clojure, Common Lisp, D, Dart, Erlang, Go, Haskell, Haxe, Io, Java, JavaScript (Node.js), Julia, Lua, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Pure Data, Python, R, Racket, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Smalltalk and Tcl. ]

h3 => [ 4) In which language Redis is written? ]
p => [ Redis is written in ANSI C and mostly used for cache solution and session management. It creates unique keys for store values. ]
h3 => [ 5) What is the usage of Redis? ]
p => [ Redis is a special key-value store database that can function as a NoSQL database or as a memory-cache store to improve performance when serving data that is stored in system memory. ]
h3 => [ 6) How to interect with Redis? ]
p => [ After the installation of the server you can run the Redis Client provided by redis installation or you can open the command prompt and use the following command: ]
p => [ By using any of them, you can interect with Redis. ]
h3 => [ 7) Which are the most popular companies using Redis? ]
p => [ Twitter, Github, Stackoverflow etc. are the most popular companies using Redis. ]
h3 => [ 8) What are the main features of Redis? ]
p => [ Following are the main features of Redis: ]
li => [ Redis is very simple to install setup and manage. ]
li => [ Redis is very fast. It can execute 100000 queries per second. ]
li => [ Redis is fast because data is being persistent in memory as well as stored on the disk. ]
li => [ Redis is very fast because it loads the whole dataset in primary memory. ]
li => [ Redis operations working on different data types are atomic so these operations can be accomplished safely i.e. to set or increase a key, add or remove elements from a set or increase a counter. ]
li => [ It supports various types of data structure such as strings, hashes, sets, lists, sorted sets etc. ]
li => [ Redis supports a variety of languages i.e. C, C++, C#, Ruby, Python, Twisted Python, PHP, Erlang, Tcl, Perl, Lua, Java, Scala etc.  ]
li => [ If your favorite language is not supported yet, you can write your own client library, as the Protocol is pretty simple. ]
li => [ Redis supports simple master to slave replication.
 ]
li => [ Redis is portable. ]

h3 => [ 9) Explain the Replication Features of Redis?  ]
p => [ Replication is important in order to archive high level of availability in big data systems. The data needs to be replicated at n number of places. This follows the master-slave approach where the master copy is maintained by master-slave and replicated to n other nodes.  ]
h3 => [ 10) What are the advantages of using Redis? ]
p => [ Following is a list of some important advantages of Redis: ]
li => [ Redis is very fast. ]
li => [ It supports a server-side locking. ]
li => [ It has a rich client side library. ]
li => [ It is a good counter. ]
li => [ It supports Atomic Operation. ]
h3 => [ 11) What are the disadvantages/limitations of using Redis? ]
p => [ Following are the disadvantages/ limitations of Redis: ]
li => [ It is single threaded. ]
li => [ It has got limited client support for consistent hashing. ]
li => [ It has significant overhead for persistence. ]
li => [ It is not deployed widely. ]
h3 => [ 12) What is the difference between Redis and RDBMS? ]
p => [ There are a lot of differences between Redis and RDBMS: ]
li => [ Redis is a NoSQL database while RDBMS is an SQL database. ]
li => [ Redis follows the key-value structure while RDBMS follows the table structure. ]
li => [ Redis extremely fast while RDBMS is comparatively slow. ]
li => [ Redis stores all the dataset in primary memory while RDBMS stores its dataset in secondary memory. ]
li => [ Redis is generally used to store small and frequently used files while RDBMS is used to store big files. ]
li => [ Redis provides only official support for Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, Solaris. It doesn?t provide official support for Windows currently while RDBMS provides support for both. ]

h3 => [ 13) Differentiate Memcached and Redis?  ]
th => [ Memcached ]
th => [ Redis ]
td => [ Memcached only does caching information.  ]
td => [ It provides some more functionalities like replication and persistence along with caching information.  ]
td => [ Memcached supports the functionality of LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction of values. ]
td => [ LRU is not supported by Redis.  ]
td => [ In Memcached, when they overflow memory, the one you have not used recently (LRU- Least Recently Used) will get deleted. ]
td => [ In Redis, there is a time set for each function, Three keys are maintained, the one, which is closest to expiry, will get deleted.  ]
td => [ CAS (Check and Set) is supported by Memcached.  ]
td => [ CAS is not supported by Redis.  ]
td => [ Array objects are needed to be serialized in order to get saved. We need to unserialize them for their retrieval.  ]
td => [ Redis has got stronger data structures; it can handle strings, binary safe strings, list of binary safe strings, sorted lists, etc. ]
td => [ Memcached has at most 250 bytes length.  ]
td => [ Redis has at most 2 GB key length. ]
td => [ It is Multi-threaded  ]
td => [ It is single threaded.  ]
h3 => [ 14) Mention Operation Keys of Redis.  ]
li => [ TYPE key ]
li => [ TTL key ]
li => [ EXPIRE key seconds ]
li => [ EXPIREAT key timestamp ]
li => [ EXISTS key ]
li => [ DEL key ]
h3 => [ 15) Which are the different data types used in Redis? ]
p => [ There are mainly 5 types of data types supported by Redis: ]
li => [ Strings ]
li => [ Hashes ]
li => [ Lists ]
li => [ Sets ]
li => [ Sorted Sets ]
a => [ Click Here ]
h3 => [ 16) Which are the most popular commands of the Redis database? ]
a => [ Click Here ]
h3 => [ 17) We all know that Reds is fast, but is it also durable? ]
p => [ In Redis, there is always a trade-of between durability and speed. In the case of system failure, it may lose data which is not stored. ]
h3 => [ 18) How can you enhance the durability of Redis?  ]
li => [ Whenever a new command is added to the append log file, call Fsysnc() each time.  ]
li => [ Keep calling Fsysnc() in every second. Despite of the 1 second data lose in the case of system fails.  ]
h3 => [ 19) What are the concerned things while using Redis?  ]
li => [ Consistent method selection in order to name and prefix the keys. Namespace management.  ]
li => [ Make key prefixes registry which can map every documents to their owner applications.  ]
li => [ Designing, implementing and testing the Garbage collection mechanism for each class we keep into the redis architecture.  ]
li => [ Maintain a sharding library before investing so much into the application.  ]
h3 => [ 20) How can you use Redis with .Net application? ]
p => [ To use Redis in .Net applications, follow these steps: ]
li => [ First, Download Redis Server. ]
li => [ Install Redis Server. ]
li => [ Download Redis Client. ]
li => [ Set Configuration into Web.config File. ]
li => [ Use Redis Client Class. ]
