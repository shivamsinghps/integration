h2 => [ 1) Write a program to reverse the words using an array? ]
strong => [ Output: ]
h2 => [ 2) What do you understand by the Red black tree? ]
p => [  The Red-black tree  is a type of self-balancing binary search tree with the extra attribute, which is the colour of the node. Colour of the node can be red or black that's why it is called as a Red-black tree. These colour attributes are used in the tree so that tree remains balanced (approx.) while insertion or deletion of a new node with time complexity of O(log n).  ]
strong => [ It requires the following rules: ]
li => [ Each node will be of Red or Black colour ]
li => [ The root node of the tree should be black.  ]

p => [ A pure virtual function in C++ is a function which has declaration but does not have any implementation in the base class. It is declared with virtual keyword and assigned a value 0. The pure virtual function used in an abstract class. This is mainly a part of runtime polymorphism. ]
strong => [ Syntax: ]
strong => [ Example: ]
strong => [ Output: ]
h2 => [ 6) What is the use of register keyword in C?  ]
p => [  In C language, we use storage class to define the scope and lifetime of the variable. The register is reserved keyword storage class. It gives hint to the compiler to store the variable in the register of memory.  We can use register keyword for fast access of variable. ]
strong => [ Syntax: ]
h2 => [ 7) What are different types of typecasting in C++?  ]
p => [ When we convert an expression from one data type to another data type, it is called as typecasting. ]
p => [ A list of different types of type casting in C++: ]

li => [ dynamic-cast ]
li => [ static_cast ]
li => [ reinterpret_cast ]
li => [ typeid  ]
li => [ const_cast ]
h2 => [ 8) What is the functionality of "volatile" keyword? ]
p => [ The volatile keyword is a qualifier which is used with the variable at declaration, which tells the compiler that the value of the variable may be changed at any time, without taking any action. ]
strong => [ Syntax: ]
h2 => [ 9) Explain the differences between classes and objects in C++? ]
p => [ C++ is an object-oriented language and its object-oriented concept totally depends on its classes and objects. The class and objects both are the co-related with each other.  ]
p => [ Some primary differences between classes and objects are: ]
th => [ Class ]
th => [ Object ]
td => [ A class is a template, which creates objects. ]
td => [ Object is an instance of its class. ]
td => [ A class only have logical existence. ]
td => [ An object has physical existence ]
td => [ A class does not allocate memory at the time of creation ]
td => [ An object requires memory at the time of creation ]
td => [ A class can be defined by keyword class followed by its name ]
td => [ An object is created by using the class name followed by the variable name. ]
td => [ A class can be defined only once. ]
td => [ An object can be created as per requirement. ]
strong => [ Syntax ]
strong => [ Syntax ]
h2 => [ 10) Let's suppose, you're given two arrays of strings. How will you find whether all strings of first array are present in the second array, and return a Boolean value? Assume both arrays have millions of elements. ]
p => [ We can solve this problem using traversing and binary searching on the array. The first array should be traversed and then apply binary search on the second array. ]
h2 => [ 11) What do you understand by "mutable" keyword? ]
li => [ The mutable keyword is used as storage class specifier in C++.  ]
li => [ We can use the mutable keyword to modify one data member of a function without affecting other data members of that function.  ]
li => [ We can modify the data members of a constant object using the mutable keyword.  ]
li => [ We can use the mutable keyword only with non-static and non-const data members of a class. ]
strong => [ Syntax: ]
h2 => [ 12) Differentiate between a reference and a pointer? ]
p => [ Reference and pointers are the approximately same concept, with some differences. Both concepts are used to have one variable which can access another variable. ]
p => [ Following are the main differences between both the concepts. ]
li => [ A pointer is used to store the address of other variables, whereas the reference is like a constant pointer, used to refer other value.  ]
li => [ A pointer can be re-assigned, whereas reference can only be assigned a value at time of initialization.  ]
li => [ We can perform pointer to pointer indirection, but we cannot perform reference to reference indirection. ]
li => [ We can directly assign a NULL value for a pointer, whereas we cannot assign the NULL value directly to a reference.  ]
li => [ A pointer has its own memory area and address at the stack, whereas reference has same address as the main variable, but also have some memory space at the stack. ]
h2 => [ 13) How can we get PID of the process in Ubuntu Linux? ]
p => [  PID  is defined as a  Process Identification Number . PID is a unique identification number which is automatically allocated to a process at the time of creation, in an operating system. To find the PID of the process in Ubuntu, Linux we can use the pidof command. ]
h2 => [ 14) Differentiate between TCP and UDP? ]
p => [  TCP and UDP  both are the  transport layer protocols  used for transmission of packets over the network. The primary difference between both the protocols are given below: ]
th => [ TCP ]
th => [ UDP ]
td => [  TCP is termed as Transmission control protocol  ]
td => [ UDP is termed as User Datagram Protocol. ]
td => [ TCP is Connection oriented protocol, which means it requires to acknowledge for each transmission. ]
td => [ UDP is a connectionless protocol, which means it does not require to acknowledge of sent datagrams. ]
td => [ TCP is a reliable protocol for transmission  ]
td => [ UDP is not a reliable protocol for transmission. ]
td => [ TCP is slower than UDP as it ensures the arrival of data to destination ]
td => [ UDP is fast compared to TCP as it does not ensure the data arrival. ]
td => [ The sequencing of data occurs in TCP ]
td => [ UDP does not have any sequencing of data. ]
td => [ The lost packets will be resent by the TCP during a transmission. ]
td => [ The lost packets will not be sent again. ]
td => [ TCP is mainly used where reliability and error-free transmission required. E.g., requesting a dynamic web page. ]
td => [ UDP is mainly used where speed is desired, and error-free transmission is not required. E.g., Online games. ]
h2 => [ 15) Write down the equation for lift?  ]
p => [ To raise an aircraft into the air a force is required which is equal to or greater than the force of gravity, such type of force is called lift. Lift acts in an upward direction opposite to the gravity force. Lift equation can be written by using the Bernoulli equation which is:  ]
p => [  P+1/2 ?V =  Constant  and continuity equation ]
p => [  ?*A*V =  Constant , so lift equation will be: ]
p => [  Where Cl  = coefficient ]
p => [  ?  = density  ]
p => [  V = velocity  ]
p => [  A  = Wing area. ]
h2 => [ 16) Explain the Null pointer? ]
p => [ A Null pointer has reserved value which shows that pointer is pointing to nothing or not a valid value. A Null pointer is mainly used to show the end of the list. A Null pointer can be useful for the following cases: ]
li => [ A null pointer can be passed as a function argument, where we don't want to pass a valid memory address. ]
li => [ A pointer is assigned as Null pointer variable when it is pointing to an invalid memory address.  ]
li => [ A null pointer can be used to perform error handling with pointers. ]
strong => [ Syntax: ]
h2 => [ 17) Tell me the size of an integer in 32-bit system? ]
p => [ The size of any data type in C depends upon compiler implementation so, the minimum size for an integer for the 32-bit system should be 2 bytes, and it may be 4 bytes or 8 bytes or more depending on the compiler. ]
h2 => [ 18) Describe your Projects? ]
p => [ The answer to the above question will be different for each candidate. The interviewer wants a detailed explanation of the projects which have candidates have already performed. The Candidate needs to have a good knowledge for every project of the technology which he has used, a concept which he has used and even every small knowledge of the project is required. ]
h2 => [ 19) How will you find a loop in a singly linked list? ]
strong => [ Output: ]
h2 => [ 20) Is it possible to go to an infinite loop for the following program? ]
p => [  Ans : For the above program, it's not possible to go to an infinite loop. Even if we define arr_size to a negative value, still it will not go for infinite value. ]
h2 => [ 21) According to you, which point of the cantilever is weakest? ]
p => [ The weakest point of cantilever depends on by which material the cantilever is constructed, and the weakest point is usually the free end. ]
h2 => [ 22) Explain Reynold's number. ]
p => [ Reynold's number is a dimensionless quantity of fluid mechanics which is used to study the flow of a fluid. It determines the flow pattern of fluid in different fluid flow situations. It is useful in predicting the transition of flow pattern from laminar to turbulent flow. Reynold's number can be defined as the ratio of the inertia force to the viscous force within a liquid. ]
p => [ The Reynold's number can be given as: ]
p => [ Where, ]
p => [ ?=density of fluid ]
p => [ u=velocity of fluid with respect to the object, ?= dynamic viscosity of the fluid ]
p => [ v=kinematics viscosity ]

p => [ One can answer this question by using the following approach: ]
h2 => [ 2) How will you manage your time, if you have plenty of work? ]
p => [ As SpaceX is well known for its long working hours so, it's very mandatory that candidate should have time management skills. It will be beneficial while doing work with SpaceX. So interviewer will ask this question so that they can judge whether you have that skill or not. ]
p => [ "Time management has always been an essential part of my life. For obtaining the time management, I create a list of work, then I prioritize the work according to the urgency. I also fix the deadlines to complete the assigned task. After completion of one task, I use to check the complete list that is there any task which have more priority and if a new task has been added to the list." ]
h2 => [ 3) Why do you want to work at SpaceX? Explain? ]
p => [ For answering this question, you should be honest and tell what you think about SpaceX and what makes you excited to work at SpaceX.  ]
p => [ See the following example: ]
p => [ "I want to work with SpaceX as I wanted to be a part of the company which makes history in the world so that I also can contribute a little bit of my knowledge towards the race to Mars, and SpaceX is one of those rare companies." ]
h2 => [ 4) Are you also searching for Job in other companies? ]
p => [ When an interviewer asks this question, they want to check how much serious you are for your career. So for answering this question, you should be very careful and try not to take the other companies name for which you have applied. Following is the example for this question. ]
p => [ "I have recently started searching for the job and also got the offer from some of the companies, but for this position in SpaceX, I was very much excited for a long time." ]

h2 => [ 7) *Why should we hire you at SpaceX? ]
p => [ SpaceX hires the best talent among lots of candidates, and if any of the interviewers will not satisfy with your answer, then the process stops immediately, so candidate should be cautious while answering this question. The interviewer wants to know that how much you think that you are suitable for that particular role. Candidate should respond by telling what different skill set or prior experience he has, which will be suitable for that role. One of the possible way to answers this question is: ]
p => [ "I have prior experience in aerospace technology, and also I have good theoretical and practical knowledge in space technology, with good communication skills and confidence which makes me most suitable for this role." ]
h2 => [ 8) Do you think, that it is possible to be a good team member, but you do not agree with your team leader? ]
p => [ By this interviewer wants to check that how will you deal if you are a good team member but not agree with the leader, he wants to check whether you will handle it positively or negatively, so try to answer confidently and little bit diplomatically. ]
p => [ "Yes I believe, it might be a situation where my team leader and I do not have same thoughts, but still I will always put my thought with complete respect showing towards him as he is our leader and try to come at a point to apply that decision which is beneficial for everyone." ]
h2 => [ 9) As I can see in your resume you have multiple gaps between employments, what was the reason for these gaps? ]
p => [ If you have various gaps during the employments, then it may be a tough question for you. But while answering this, you must be honest as if you will lie you can be caught, so whatever was the reason, clearly specify that reason.  ]
p => [ "The main reason for these gaps was to get hired in the best company. Although I got various offers during the job search, still I wanted to join the best among those so that I can work for them for a long time". ]
