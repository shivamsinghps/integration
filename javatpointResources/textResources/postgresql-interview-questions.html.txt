h3 => [ 7) What do you understand by string constants in PostgreSQL?  ]
p => [ In the PostgreSQL database, a string constant is a sequence of some character bounded by single quotes ('). For example: 'This is an example of string Constant'. ]
h3 => [ 8) What is the maximum size for a table in PostgreSQL? ]
p => [ PostgreSQL provides unlimited user database size, but it doesn't provide an unlimited size for tables. In PostgreSQL, the maximum size for a table is set to 32 TB.  ]
h3 => [ 9) What do you understand by a partitioned table in PostgreSQL?  ]
p => [ In PostgreSQL, a partitioned table is a logical structure used to split a large table into smaller pieces. These small pieces of the tables are called partitions.  ]
h3 => [ 10) What is Multi-Version Concurrency Control in PostgreSQL? Why is it used?  ]
p => [ Multi-Version Concurrency Control or MVCC is an advanced technique in PostgreSQL that improves database performance in a multi-user environment. It is mainly used to avoid unnecessary locking of the database by removing the time lag for the user to log into his database. This time lag occurs when someone else is accessing the content. In Multi-Version Concurrency Control or MVCC, all the transactions are kept as records. That's why PostgreSQL maintains data consistency, unlike most other database systems which use locks for concurrency control.  ]
h3 => [ 11) What is the key difference between multi-version and lock models? ]
p => [ The key difference between Multi-Version Concurrency Control and lock models is that in MVCC, the locks acquired for querying or reading the data doesn't conflict with locks acquired for writing data. In this case, reading never blocks writing, and writing never blocks reading. So, Multi-Version Concurrency Control has the upper hand compared to other lock models.  ]
h3 => [ 12) What is pgAdmin in the PostgreSQL server? Why is it used?  ]
p => [ In the PostgreSQL server, PgAdmin is a free, open-source PostgreSQL database administration GUI or tool used in Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux systems. PgAdmin is used to retrieve, develop, conduct quality testing, and maintain databases or other ongoing maintenances.  ]
h3 => [ 13) How can you set up pgAdmin in PostgreSQL?  ]
p => [ To set up pgAdmin in PostgreSQL, we should follow the steps given below: ]
li => [ First, start and launch pgAdmin 4. ]
li => [ Then, go to the "Dashboard" tab, click on the "Quick Link" section and then click on "Add new Server." ]
li => [ After clicking on the "Add new Server", you have to select the "Connection" tab in the "Create-Server" window. ]
li => [ Now, configure the connection by entering your server's IP address in the "Hostname/Address" field. ]
li => [ At last, you have to specify the "Port" as "5432," which is the by default port for the PostgreSQL server. ]
h3 => [ 14) What do you understand by PL/Python?  ]
p => [ PostgreSQL provides support to a procedural language known as PL/Python.  ]
h3 => [ 15) What are the Indices of PostgreSQL? ]
p => [ Indices of PostgreSQL are inbuilt functions or methods such as GIST Indices, hash table, and B-tree (Binary tree). The user uses these to scan the index in a backward manner. PostgreSQL also facilitates their users to define their indices of PostgreSQL.  ]
h3 => [ 16) What is the way to avoid unnecessary locking of a database?  ]
p => [ The best way to avoid unnecessary database locking is to use MVCC (Multi-version concurrency control). It is an advanced technique used in PostgreSQL for improving database performances.  ]

li => [ Comparison operators ]
li => [ Logical operators ]
li => [ Bitwise operators ]
h3 => [ 18) What are the tokens in PostgreSQL?  ]
p => [ In PostgreSQL, tokens are the building blocks of any source code. Tokens contain several types of special character symbols like constants, quoted identifiers, other identifiers, and keywords. The keywords tokens contain pre-defined SQL commands and meanings. On the other hand, identifiers specify variable names like columns, tables, etc. ]
h3 => [ 19) What does a schema contain in PostgreSQL? ]
p => [ In PostgreSQL, a schema contains tables and data types, views, indexes, operators, sequences, and functions.  ]
h3 => [ 20) What are some new characteristics introduced in Postgre 9.1?  ]
p => [ The new PostgreSQL 9.1 version is working on important features such as JSON support, synchronous replication, nearest-neighbor geographic searches, SQL/MED external data connections, security labels, and index-only access. ]
p => [ Following is a list of some newly added characteristics in PostgreSQL 9.1: ]

It also has an add-on like PostGIS database extender. ]
p => [ Michel Stonebraker is known as the father of PostgreSQL. He started and led the development of this database in 1986 as a follow-up project to its predecessor, Ingres, now owned by Computer Associates. PostgreSQL was originally called Postgres. It is pronounced PostgreSQL because of its ubiquitous support for the SQL standards among most relational databases. PostgreSQL is used as a by default database in MAC OS. ]
p => [ Postgres was started by Michael Stonebraker in 1986 as a follow-up project to its predecessor, Ingres, which Computer Associates now own. The name Postgres was derived from its predecessor Ingres. Here, Postgres means "after Ingres". The first project of Postgres was developed between 1986 - 1994. It has provided many sophisticated features such as Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested transactions (savepoints), online/hot backups, a sophisticated query planner/optimizer, and write-ahead logging for fault tolerance. ]

h3 => [ 28) How do you update the stats or statistics in PostgreSQL?  ]
p => [ To update stats or statistics in PostgreSQL, we have to call a special function called explicit 'vacuum'. This function creates a Vacuum where the option of Analyze is used to update statistics in PostgreSQL. ]
strong => [ Syntax: ]
h3 => [ 29) What is the difference between clustered index and non clustered index in PostgreSQL?  ]
p => [ The main difference between clustered index and non clustered index in PostgreSQL is that the clustered index is an index type used to sort table data rows according to their key values. In RDBMS, a user can create a clustered index based on that column using the primary key. On the other hand, a non-clustered index is an index where the order of the rows does not match the physical order of the actual data. The non-clustered index is ordered by the columns that make up the index.  ]
h3 => [ 30) What are the advantages of specifying data types in columns while creating a table? ]

h3 => [ 32) What is the way to delete complete data from an existing table in PostgreSQL?  ]
p => [ The best way to delete complete data from an existing table in PostgreSQL is to use the TRUNCATE TABLE command.  ]
h3 => [ 33) What are the disadvantages of the DROP TABLE command in deleting complete data from an existing table? ]
p => [ In PostgreSQL, the DROP TABLE command can be used to delete complete data from an existing table, but the biggest disadvantage of using the DROP TABLE command is that it removes complete table structure from the database. If you use the DROP TABLE command to delete the table, you must re-create a table to store data.  ]
h3 => [ 34) What are the different properties of a transaction in PostgreSQL? ]
p => [ Like other RDBMS, PostgreSQL also supports ACID properties. This is commonly referred to by the acronym named ACID. It means the properties of a transaction in PostgreSQL include Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.  ]
