h1 => [ PyTorch Interview Questions ]
p => [  A list of frequently asked  PyTorch Interview Questions and Answers  are given below. ]
h3 => [ 1) What is PyTorch? ]
p => [  PyTorch is a part of computer software based on torch library, which is an open-source Machine learning library for Python. It is a deep learning framework which was developed by the Facebook artificial intelligence research group. It is used for the application such as  Natural Language Processing  and  Computer Vision . ]

h3 => [ 2) What are the essential elements of PyTorch? ]
p => [ There are the following elements which are essential in PyTorch: ]
li => [ PyTorch tensors ]
li => [ PyTorch NumPy ]
li => [ Mathematical operations ]
li => [ Autograd Module ]
li => [ Optim Module ]
li => [ nn Module ]
h3 => [ 3) What is Tensors? ]
p => [ Tensors play an important role in deep learning with PyTorch. In simple words, we can say, this framework is completely based on tensors. A tensor is treated as a generalized matrix. It could be a 1D tensor (vector), 2D tensor(matrix), 3D tensor(cube) or 4D tensor(cube vector). ]

h3 => [ 4) What is the levels of abstraction? ]
p => [ There are three levels of abstraction, which are as follows: ]
strong => [ Tensor: ]
strong => [ Variable: ]
strong => [ Module: ]
h3 => [ 5) Are tensor and matrix the same? ]
p => [ We can't say that tensor and matrix are the same. Tensor has some properties through which we can say both have some similarities such as we can perform all the mathematical operation of the matrix in tensor. ]
p => [ A tensor is a mathematical entity which lives in a structure and interacts with other mathematical entity. If we transform the other entities in the structure in a regular way, then the tensor will obey a related transformation rule. This dynamical property of tensor makes it different from the matrix. ]
h3 => [ 6) What is the use of torch.from_numpy()? ]
p => [  The  torch.from_numpy()  is one of the important property of torch which places an important role in tensor programming. It is used to create a tensor from numpy.ndarray. The ndarray and return tensor share the same memory. If we do any changes in the returned tensor, then it will reflect the ndaaray also. ]
h3 => [ 7) What is variable and autograd.variable? ]
p => [  Variable  is a package which is used to wrap a tensor. The  autograd.variable  is the central class for the package. The torch.autograd provides classes and functions for implementing automatic differentiation of arbitrary scalar-valued functions. It needs minimal changes to the existing code. We only need to declare tensor for which gradients should be computed with the requires_grad=True keyword. ]
h3 => [ 8) How do we find the derivatives of the function in PyTorch? ]
p => [  The derivatives of the function are calculated with the help of the  Gradient . There are four simple steps through which we can calculate derivative easily. ]
p => [ These steps are as follows: ]
li => [ Initialization of the function for which we will calculate the derivatives. ]
li => [ Set the value of the variable which is used in the function. ]
li => [ Compute the derivative of the function by using the backward () method.  ]
li => [ Print the value of the derivative using grad. ]
h3 => [ 9) What do you mean by Linear Regression? ]
p => [  Linear Regression is a technique or way to find the linear relation between the dependent variable and the independent variable by minimizing the distance. It is a supervised machine learning approach which is used for classification of  order discrete category .  ]

h3 => [ 11) What is the use of MSELoss, CTCLoss, and BCELoss function? ]
p => [ MSE stands for Mean Squared Error, which is used to create a criterion the measures the mean squared error between each element in an input x and target y. The CTCLoss stands for Connectionist Temporal Classification Loss, which is used to calculate the loss between continuous time series and target sequence. The BCELoss(Binary Cross Entropy) is used to create a criterion to measures the Binary Cross Entropy between the target and the output. ]
h3 => [ 12) Give any one difference between torch.nn and torch.nn.functional? ]
p => [  The torch.nn provide us many more classes and modules to implement and train the neural network. The  torch.nn.functional  contains some useful function like activation function and convolution operation, which we can use. However, these are not full layers, so if we want to define a layer of any kind, we have to use  torch.nn . ]
h3 => [ 13) What do you mean by Mean Squared Error? ]
p => [ The mean squared error tells us about how close a regression line to a set of points. Mean squared error done this by taking the distance from the points to the regression line and squaring them. Squaring is required to remove any negative signs. ]

h3 => [ 15) What is Activation function? ]
p => [  A neuron should be activated or not, is determined by an activation function. The Activation function calculates a weighted sum and further adding bias with it to give the result. The  Neural Network  is based on the Perceptron, so if we want to know the working of the neural network, then we have to learn how perceptron work.  ]
h3 => [ 16) How Neural Network differs from Deep Neural Network? ]
