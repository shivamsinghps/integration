h2 => [ 1) A horse covers a distance of 1500 meters in 1 minute and 20 seconds. At what speed the horse is running? ]
li => [ 67.2 km/hr ]
li => [ 67.7 km/hr ]
li => [ 67. 5 km/hr ]
li => [ 67.9 km/hr ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  c ]
p => [  Explanation:   ]
p => [  Speed = Distance/Time 
Distance = 1500 meters 
Time = 1 minute 20 seconds â†’ 60+20=80 seconds 
So, Required Speed =1500/80=75/4m/s 
We need the answer in km/hr: 
So, Speed in km/hr = (75/4)*(18/5) = 67.5 km/hr ]
h2 => [ 2) A train moving at speed of 80 km/hr crosses a pole in 7 seconds. Find the length of the train. ]
li => [ 150 m ]
li => [ 165 m ]
li => [ 175 m ]
li => [ 170 m ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  c ]
p => [  Explanation:   ]
p => [  Length of the train is equal to the distance covered by train to cross the pole. So, we will find the distance travelled by train in 7 seconds by applying the following formula: 
Distance= Speed x Time 
Speed is given in Km/hr so we will convert it into m/s as answers are given in meters. 
Speed=90* (5/18)= 25 m/s 
Time = 7 seconds 
Distance = 25 * 7= 175 meters ]

li => [ 10 pm ]
li => [ 11 pm ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  c ]
p => [  Explanation:   ]
p => [  Time from 4 am on a day to 9 pm on the 4 th  day = 89 hours ]
p => [ As per the question, 23 hrs 44 minutes of this clock = 24 hours of the correct clock as this clock loses 16 minutes in 24 hours.  ]
p => [ 23 hrs 44 minutes = 356/15 hrs ]
p => [ Now, 356/15 Hrs of this clock = 24 hours of correct clock ]
p => [ 89 hours of this clock = (24*15/356) * 89 = 90 hours of the correct clock, i.e. the correct clock gains one hour over the incorrect clock. ]
p => [ The correct time on the fourth day would be 10pm. ]

p => [ Time = Distance/Speed ]
p => [ Distance= 400 ]
p => [ Speed = 15km/hr or 15* (5/18) = 75/18 = 25/6 m/s ]

li => [ 10/31 ]
li => [ 10/19 ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  b ]
p => [  Explanation:   ]
p => [  Total number of balls = (2+3+2) = 7 
Let S be the sample space. 
Then, n (S) = the total number of ways of drawing two balls out of 7: 
=  7 C 2 
= (7*6) / (2*1) = 42/2 =21 ]
p => [ Let E is the event of drawing 2 balls, none of which is blue. ]
p => [  n (E) = number of ways of drawing 2 balls out of (2+3) balls. 
=  5 C 2 
= (5*4) /(2*1) = 10 ]
p => [ So, P(E) = n(E)/n(S) = 10/21 ]

span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  a ]
p => [  Explanation:   ]
p => [  As per the question: 
n (S) = 6*6 = 36 
And, the event that the sum is a prime number:  
E = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), 
(5, 2), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5)} 
So, n (E) = 15 
P(E)= n(E)/n(S) = 15/36 = 5/12 ]

li => [ Rs. 180 ]
li => [ Rs. 204 ]
li => [ Rs. 210 ]
li => [ Rs. 220 ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  b ]
p => [  Explanation:   ]
p => [  Principal (P) = Rs. 2500 
Rate of interest(r) = 4% 
Time (t) = 2 years 
Compound Interest = Amount - Principal 
Amount (A) =P[(1+(r/100)] t   
=2500[1+(4/100)] 2 
=2500+ [(Y-X)*100]/X 
C.I = 2704-2500 =Rs. 204 ]
h2 => [ 10) The first republic day of India was celebrated on January 26, 1950. What day of the week was it? ]
li => [ Wednesday ]
li => [ Friday ]
li => [ Thursday ]
li => [ Tuesday ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  c ]
p => [  Explanation:   ]
p => [ 1600 years are divisible by 400, so the year 1600 has 0 odd days. ]
p => [ =&gt; 300 years have 1 odd day. ]
p => [ =&gt; 49 years = (12 leap years + 37 years) ]
p => [ = (12*2, odd days + 37*1, odd days) ]
p => [ = 24 + 37 = 61 odd days ]
p => [ On dividing 61 by 7, we get remainder 5, so 49 years have 5 odd days. ]
p => [ =&gt;From January 26, 1950, to January 26, 1950, we have 26 days. ]
p => [ 26 days = 3 weeks + 5 odd days ]
p => [ So, total number of odd days = 1 + 5 + 5 = 11 days ]
p => [ =&gt;11 days = 1 week + 4 odd days ]
p => [ 4 Odd days represent Thursday, so it was Thursday on January 26, 1950. ]

h2 => [ Puzzle Interview Questions ]
h2 => [ There are 5 race tracks to run 25 horses. Find out the three fastest horses among the total horses and what is the minimum number of races required to find the three fastest horses without the use of stopwatch? ]
strong => [ Answer: ]
p => [ 1. Divide the 25 horses into five groups. We have five horses in each group. Following the conditions and limitations, we conduct five races of the groups separately. The first one is the fastest horse, second and third are faster horses as follows: ]
p => [  1st Race: X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 
2nd Race: X6 X7 X8 X9 X10 
3rd Race: X11 X12 X13 X14 X15 
4th Race: X16 X17 X18 X19 X20 
5th Race: X21 X22 X23 X24 X25 ]
p => [ 2. There are five fastest horses: X1 X6 X11 X16 X21. But these are not necessarily the fastest horses. So we conduct sixth race among these horses to find the three fastest horses. ]
p => [ 3. Just say X1 X6 X11 are the three fastest horses and we can eliminate X16, X21 definitely not in the top 3. But the solution doesn't come at this outcome, just think what about other faster horses in the first five races and their elimination. Automatically, we can eliminate all the horses that X16 and X21 competed against in the preliminary races ? since X16 and X21 are not in the top 3 then we also know that any horse that's slower than these 2 is definitely not in the top 3 either. So we eliminate X17, X18, X22, and X23 along with X16 and X21.  ]
p => [ 4. We know that X1 is the fastest horse in the group since he was the fastest horse out of the first five fastest horses and we don't need to race X1 anymore. ]
p => [  5. Again, we eliminate horses in further races. We know that X6 and X11 are the 2 nd  and 3 rd  fastest horses. So, we are able to eliminate X8 since X8 is slower than X7 and we eliminate X8. Further, we can also eliminate X12 and X13 since X11 was the 3rd fastest in the group leaders, and X12 and X13 were slower than X11. ]
p => [ 6. And after the sixth race, we can eliminate these horses altogether: X17, X18, X22, X23, X16, X21, X12, X13, X8, and X1. ]
p => [ 7. Now, we have the following horses to determine the second and third fastest horses: ]
p => [  X2 X3 
X6 X7 
X11 ]
p => [ 8. So, this is the seventh and the last race among X2, X3, X6, X7, and X11. We get the top 2 fastest horses from this race as second and third place fastest horses. ]
p => [ 9. Finally, we got our solution as 7 races to find the top 3 horses ]
h2 => [ 2) A birthday cake had cut equally into 8 equal pieces in exactly 3 cuts. What was the cutting way of cake? ]

h2 => [ 3) If an elephant has two eyes, a monkey has two eyes and a lion has two eyes then how many eyes do we have? ]

h2 => [ 4) Using UMNI (four letter word), create a seven letter word. ]

h2 => [ 5) Having no other type of animals, a cage has 72 heads and 200 feet having only two types of animals i.e. rabbit and chicken. What is the number of rabbits and chickens in the cage? ]
p => [  Answer:  Let r be the number of rabbits, and c the number of chickens. 
Number of heads: 
r + c = 72 ......(1) 
Number of feet: 
4r + 2c = 200 .......(2) 
Taking (1) 
r = 72 - c  
Put the value of r in (2) 
4 *(72 - c ) + 2c = 200 
288 ? 4c + 2c= 200 
2 c = 88 
c = 44 
and r =72 -c 
r = 72- 44 = 28 
r = 28 ]
p => [ So in cage, there are 44 chickens and 28 rabbits. ]
