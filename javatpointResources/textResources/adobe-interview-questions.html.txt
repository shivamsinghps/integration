li => [ 301 ]
li => [ 300 ]
li => [ 250 ]
li => [ 401 ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  a ]
p => [  Explanation:   
Bulb flash on every 9 seconds. 
他 of an hour= 他* 60 = 45 min  
45 min= 45*60 = 2700 seconds 
So light will flash in 他 of an hour= 2700/9= 300 times 
But count starts after the first flash hence the total number of time = 300+1= 301 ]

li => [ None of the above ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  a ]
p => [  Explanation: 
The present age of Arjun, Ram, and Vivek is in the ratio of 4:7:9 
Let, the present age of Arjun= 4x 
Present age of Ram= 7x 
Present age of Vivek= 9x 
As per question 
(4x-9)+ (7x-9) + (9x-9) = 53 
20x-27=53 
X=4 
So the present age of Arjun= 16, Ram= 28, and Vivek = 36 ]
h2 => [ 3) If the average age of employees in an office is 40 years and 120 new employees joined the company whose average age is 32 years. Hence the average age of all employees decreased by 4 years. So what is the total number of employees in the company now? ]
li => [ 1200 ]
li => [ 120 ]
li => [ 360 ]
li => [ 240 ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  d ]
p => [  Explanation:   
Let's x be an initial total number of employees 
Initial average age of employees = 40 years  
(Initial total age of employee)/x=40 
Initial total age of employees= 40x  
Total age of 120 employees= 32*120 
 As per question : 
Average age is decreased by 4, hence  
(40x+32*120)/(x+120) = (40-4) 
(40x+3840)=36*(x+120) 
4x=4320-3840 
X=120 
So total number of employees now in the company = 120+120= 240 ]

p => [  Answer:  a ]
p => [  Explanation:   
Let's one day work by C = x 
1-day work by A= 1/8 
1-day work by B= 1/6 
As per question: 
1/8+1/6+x= 1/3 
By solving the equation: 
x=1/24 
If x's  
1 day work = 1/24 
So two day's work by c = 1/12 ]

li => [ 20 min ]
li => [ 80 min ]
li => [ 60 min ]
li => [ 40 min ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  c ]
p => [  Explanation:   
Let suppose t is usual time to reach to office from home, Usual time and speed time= t, speed = s 
Late time and speed 25% slower speed = 3/4s, time= t+20 
D = s*t 
D= (3s/4)*(t+20) 
S*t= (3s/4)*(t+20) 
4t= 3t+60 
t= 60 min. ]
h2 => [ 8) A shopkeeper sells one table for Rs. 840 at a gain of 20% and another table for Rs. 960 at a loss of 4%. What will be his total gain or loss? ]
li => [ 100/17% gain ]
li => [ 100/17% loss ]
li => [ 20/3% gain ]
li => [ None of them. ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  a ]
p => [  Explanation:   
Cost price for 1 table = (100*840) / (100+20) = 700 
Cost price for 2 table = (100*960) / (100-4) = 1000 
Total cost price of tables = 1000+700=1700 
Total selling price = 840+960 = 1800 
Gain = selling price- cost price 
Gain = 1800-1700= 100 
Gain%= (100*100) / 1700 
Gain% = 100/17 ]
h2 => [ 9) If in a conical tent, there is a space for accommodation of 10 persons. Each person must have 6 sq. Meter space to stand and 30 cubic meters of air to breathe. What will be the height of the cone? ]
li => [ 15m ]
li => [ 37.5m ]
li => [ 75m ]
li => [ 150m ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  30m ]
p => [  Explanation:   
If, Space occupied by 1 person= 6 sq. m  
Space occupied by 10 person = 60sq. m 
Hence base area of conical tent= pi*r*r = 60 
As each person needs air to breath = 30 cubic meter 
10 person needs air to breadth= 300 cubic meter 
So, the volume of the conical tent, (1/3)*pi*r*r*h= 600 
20*h= 600 
h= 30m ]
h2 => [ 10) A can do a piece of work in 10 days, B can do the same work in 12 days and Ravi in 15 days. They all start the work together, but A leaves after 2 days and B leaves 3 days before the completion of work. Find the days in which work will be completed. ]
li => [ 6 days ]
li => [ 5 days  ]
li => [ 9 days ]
li => [ 7 days ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  d ]
p => [  Explanation:   
The work completed by, 
A in 10 days, B in 12 days, C in 15 days,  
Total work done to be completed= L.C.M of (10, 12, 15) = 60unit  
So A can do 6 unit of work in 1 day, B can do 5 unit, C can do 4 unit  
As per the question, Let in x days' remaining work will be completed, then 
(6+5+4)*2+ (5+4)*(x-3) + (4*3) = 60 unit 
After solving, 
30+ 9(x-3) +12=60 
X=5 days 
So total required days = 5+2= 7 days. ]

h2 => [ 5) Differentiate between new and malloc()?  ]
p => [ The new and malloc() both are used for dynamic memory allocation. But there are various differences between new and malloc, which are given below, ]
li => [ new is an operator in C language, whereas malloc() is a function for memory allocation.  ]
li => [ new operator calls the constructor, whereas malloc() does not call the constructor.  ]
strong => [ free store ]
li => [ On failure of execution, new operator throws an exception, whereas malloc() returns Null. ]
li => [ new operator does not require the sizeof() operator, malloc() function requires the sizeof() operator to know the memory size. ]
h2 => [ 6) Differentiate between process and thread?  ]
p => [ Following are the basic differences between the process and the thread: ]
li => [ The Process is an execution of a program, whereas thread is a lightweight process. ]
li => [ A Process does not share the resources like memory, whereas thread can share the resources. ]
li => [ The Process takes more time for context switching, whereas thread requires less time for context switching.  ]
li => [ The Process is less efficient as compared to a thread in terms of communication. ]
h2 => [ 7) What is C++ Shorthand property? What is its role? ]
p => [ C++ provides shorthand property, which enables a programmer to use the assignment operator in a shorter way. ]

li => [ It manages all other programs in the computer after loaded, by a boot program.  ]
li => [ OS works as a backbone for the computer or mobile devices.  ]
li => [ Examples of an operating system are UNIX, LINUX, MS-
Windows, MAC-OS, etc. ]
h2 => [ 12) Why we use pointers in C and C++? ]
p => [ Pointers are the variables which stores address of another variable in C and C++.  ]
p => [ Following are the main reasons that why we use pointers in C and C++: ]
li => [ Pointers can be used for dynamic memory allocation. ]
li => [ Pointers help to perform array arithmetic and accessing an array element.  ]
li => [ Pointers are helpful in creating API. ]
li => [ Pointers are used in the implementation of the data structure. ]
li => [ Pointers are beneficial to pass by reference. ]
h2 => [ 13) Differentiate between call by pointer and call by reference? ]
p => [ In C++ language, we can pass an argument to a function by reference or by pointer, both are the correct approaches and precisely same, but the basic differences between both are: ]
li => [ We can assign pointer as a null pointer directly, but it cannot be done with reference.  ]
li => [ We can reassign a pointer, but reference cannot be reassigned. ]
h2 => [ 14) What do you understand by calloc() and malloc()? ]
p => [ In C, calloc() and malloc() are the library functions, and both are used for dynamic memory allocation. Which means it allocates the memory at run-time as per requirement from the heap section.  ]
p => [  malloc() : malloc() function is a library function which allocates a single block of requested memory and return a pointer void to it, which can be cast to any return type. It returns the null value if sufficient memory is not available. ]
strong => [ Syntax: ]
p => [  calloc() : calloc() function is also a library function which allocates the multiple blocks of memory of requested size. It initially initializes the memory to zero and returns NULL if memory is not sufficient. ]
strong => [ Syntax: ]
h2 => [ 15) Explain the term, "virtual machine"? ]
p => [ The Virtual machine is a software program which behaves like a separate computer. It works same as the main computer and also capable of running applications and other programs. A virtual machine, called as a guest is created within the main machine called as host. There are two types of virtual machines depending upon their uses. ]
li => [ System virtual machine ]
li => [ Process virtual machine ]
h2 => [ 16) What do you understand by Synchronization? ]
p => [  Synchronization  is a process of performing two things simultaneously at the same time.  ]
strong => [ Synchronization is of two types: ]
li => [ Process or thread synchronization ]
li => [ Data synchronization ]
p => [  Process synchronization : Process/thread synchronization is a mechanism which controls the access of shared resources between two concurrent threads. It ensures that two concurrent thread do not share the same resource at the same time. Synchronization deals with problems such as deadlock, starvation, busy waiting, etc. ]
p => [  Data Synchronization : Data synchronization is a technique which ensure the integrity of data between two devices. With the help of data synchronization, it keeps multiple copies of single data in different location. It includes file synchronization, journaling, Raid, etc. ]
h2 => [ 17) Explain the term Mutex? What is Reader-writer problem? ]
strong => [ Mutex: ]
strong => [ Mutex(mutual exclusion object) ]
li => [ Mutex ensures the proper thread synchronization between two or more threads. Only one thread can execute a program or resources at a time. ]
p => [ Reader-writer problem: ]
p => [ In OS, a situation is called as Reader-writer problem for a particular shared data area which involves: ]
li => [ Any number of reader can read from that shared area, but only one writer can write at one time.  ]
li => [ No other process can access that area when one writer is writing in that particular area.  ]
li => [ If in that shared area there are non-zero readers then writer cannot write there. ]
p => [ This problem mostly occurs in Concurrency or multithreading. ]
h2 => [ 18) Why we use void keyword? ]
p => [ We can use void keyword for two purposes:  ]
p => [  Function parameter : When we use void as function parameter, it means function does not accept any value. ]
strong => [ Example: ]
p => [  Function Return type : When we use void as function return type, it means it will not return anything. ]
strong => [ Example: ]
p => [ void keyword can also be used with the pointers which makes it more powerful as, when void is used with pointer it termed as generic type, which can hold address of any type. ]
h2 => [ 19) Explain the exit controlled loop? ]
p => [ An Exit controlled loop is a type of loop which first execute the instruction and then checks the condition. When we use exit controlled loop, then at least one time execution occurs even if the condition is false. The do-while loop is an example of exit controlled loop. ]
h2 => [ 20) What is a DNS server? ]
p => [  DNS server is a main part of  DNS (Domain Name System)  infrastructure. It is a computer server which stores and manages the database of IP addresses and their respective Hosts name.  ]
p => [ DNS server is also called as name server, which is used to map the domain name to the corresponding IP address. ]
p => [ A single domain name can have multiple IP's that means IP addresses can vary with time. ]
h2 => [ Technical Second Round ]
h2 => [ 1) What are the different layers in TCP/IP models? Explain the protocols at each layer? ]
p => [  TCP/IP model  is termed as  Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol . TCP/IP model is a practical and concise version of the OSI model. Current network architecture depends on the TCP/IP model. It consists of mainly four layers: ]
li => [ Application Layer  ]
li => [ Transport Layer/Host-to-host layer ]
li => [ Network Layer ]
li => [ Link Layer/Network Access Layer ]
strong => [ 1. Link Layer: ]
p => [ is responsible for the physical flow of data through the network. It consists of hardware devices such as optical fibre, coaxial cable, or twisted pair, etc. In this layer, data travels in the form of bits and frames.  ]
p => [ The protocol used at this level is Ethernet, token ring, etc. ]
strong => [ 2. Internet Layer: ]
p => [  Internet layer is the Upper layer of the Link layer. This layer converts the data into data-packets, called as IP datagrams and send these datagrams across the host through the network. These datagrams consist of host and destination address, by which they are forwarded through the network.  ]
p => [ The primary protocols used at this level are: ]
strong => [ IP (internet protocol) ]
strong => [ ICMP (Internet control message protocol) ]
strong => [ ARP (Address resolution protocol) ]
p => [  3. Transport Layer : This is the third layer of the TCP/IP model, which is responsible for the communication between the source host and destination host and error-free data transmission. ]
strong => [ This layer consists of mainly two protocols: ]
p => [  TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) : TCP is a reliable protocol for error-free communication between the source and destination host. It's a connection-oriented protocol. ]
p => [  UDP (User Datagram Protocol) : This protocol is not reliable as compare to TCP protocol, we can use this protocol which does not require reliable communication. It is a connectionless protocol. ]
p => [  4. Application layer : This is the top layer of the TCP/IP model. It describes the application protocol and provides node-to-node communication.  ]
p => [ This layer contains various higher level protocols which are: ]
li => [ HTTP and HTTPs(Hypertext transfer protocol)  ]
li => [ FTP(File transfer protocol) ]
li => [ SSH( Secure Shell) ]
li => [ TFTP(Trivial file transfer protocol) ]
li => [ SMTP(Simple mail transfer protocol) ]
li => [ DHCP(Dynamic host configuration protocol) ]
h2 => [ 2) Explain the working of the stack while calling a function? When stack overflow occurred? ]
p => [ The Stack is a particular area of RAM, just like as Heap. But stack is used to store local variables, parameters and return values used inside a function and stack stores and deallocates memory automatically. ]
strong => [ When we call a function, stack performs following steps: ]
li => [ Push space for the return variables. ]
li => [ Push parameters in the stack. ]
li => [ Push the local variable of the function. ]
p => [ When we call a function, stack adds a stack frame which consists space for actual parameters, local variables, return address, etc. This stack frame lives in active frame till the time function is being called, and once execution finishes then stack remove that stack frame from the stack.  ]
p => [  Stack Overflow : As we know that stack deallocated the memory and free up space after execution but still there is a condition when complete stack space used, and there is no more space to save the variables, so this is called stack overflow. It occurs because the space size of the stack is also limited in size, and at the time of execution if we allocate more memory than available memory than overflow occurred and the program got crashed. Some example for stack overflow are: ]
li => [ Use of Infinite recursion ]
li => [ Use of very large stack variable  ]
li => [ Use of very deep recursion ]
h2 => [ 3) Explain the meaning for the declaration: int*const p &amp; const int* const p? ]
p => [  int * const p : By declaring a pointer in such a way that means we are declaring point variable p as constant, which cannot be changed. We cannot change the address its holding, or it cannot point to other variables. If we try to change the address of p, then it will give a compile time error.  ]
p => [  const int * const p : By declaring a pointer in such a way means, we cannot change the address of the pointer as we as we cannot change the address at that address. If we try to do it, then it will generate a compile time error. ]
h2 => [ 4) What are default functions in C++ ]
p => [ C++ provides the six default member functions which are given below: ]
li => [ Default constructor  ]

li => [ Copy constructors ]
li => [ Copy assignment operators ]
li => [ Move constructors ]
li => [ Move assignment operators ]
h2 => [ 5) Which data structure is used for the dictionary?  ]
p => [ To implement a dictionary, which type of data structure should be used depends on what we required, there are some following data structure which can be used for implementation of the dictionary.  ]
p => [  Hash-table : If we want a simple dictionary with no option for the prefix, or nearest neighbour search then we can use Hashing or Hashtable for the dictionary.  ]
p => [  Trie : It can be a good option if we want to add prefix and fast lookup. But, it takes more space than other data structures.  ]
p => [  Ternary Search Tree : If we want all the qualities like trie but do not want to give the more space then we can use ternary search tree. ]
p => [  BK-tree : BK-tree is one of the best data structure if we want specifications like spell checker, find the similar word, etc. ]
h2 => [ 6) How can you find a unique word from a String which also has duplicate words? ]
p => [ We can find the unique word from a string by using HashMap, Set and Regex. ]

p => [ Tower of Hanoi is a very popular mathematics puzzle. In this puzzle, we are given three disk and three rods. Disks are arranged in the first rod like a stack, in ascending order. We need to transfer the disk from the first rod to third in the same order. ]
strong => [ There are some rules as well: ]
li => [ We can move one disk at one time  ]
li => [ We can only move the uppermost disk ]
li => [ Disk always should be in ascending order, i.e., a bigger disk cannot put on a smaller one. ]
strong => [ Algorithm: ]
p => [ Let's suppose there are thee towers Beg, Aux, and Dest, and there are two disks where n disk is larger disk and n-1 is smaller one. ]
strong => [ Start ]
p => [  Step 1 : shift n-1 disk from tower Beg to Aux ]

li => [ Two-dimensional array ( but it will take lots of space) ]
li => [ Sparse matrix ]
li => [ Map, etc. ]
h2 => [ 4) Explain memory protection in OS. ]
p => [ Memory protection is a mechanism which controls the unauthorized access of memory in the computer. Memory protection prevents the unallocated memory access by a process. Memory address is first checked before used by a process, to see whether it is allocated address or not. ]
p => [ There are two registers LBR and UBR are used to implement memory protection. ]
h2 => [ 5) What is Virtual Memory in OS? ]
p => [  Virtual Memory is memory management technique  of Operating System. Virtual memory is an extra space provided to a program when a main memory does not have the sufficient space to execute a code. It temporarily transfers data from RAM to disk storage, which uses inactive memory of hard disk, which is termed as Virtual Memory. ]
h2 => [ 6) Write an algorithm to insert an element into a sorted linked list? ]
p => [ Suppose the linked list is sorted in ascending order then following is the algorithm for the same. Let the input node is 13 and let assign as n  ]
p => [  Suppose Input linked list is : ]
p => [ 1) If given linked list is empty then assign the node as head and return it.
 ]
p => [ 2) If value of the node n is less than value of head node, then insert the node at start and assign it as head. ]
p => [ 3) In a loop, search the appropriate node after which the input node is to be inserted. To search the appropriate node start from head, keep moving until you reach a node x(Let?s suppose 15)whose value is greater than the input node. The node before the x will be the appropriate node(11). ]
p => [ 4) Insert the node(13) after the appropriate node(11) found in step 3. ]
