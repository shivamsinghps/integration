strong => [ Parallel jobs: ]
h3 => [ 28) State the difference between an Operational DataStage and a Data Warehouse? ]
p => [ An Operational DataStage can be considered as a presentation area for user processing and real-time analysis. Thus, operational DataStage is a temporary repository. Whereas the Data Warehouse is used for durable data storage needs and holds the complete data of the entire business. ]
h3 => [ 29) What is the importance of the exception activity in DataStage? ]
p => [ The reason behind the importance of exception activity is that during the job execution, exception activity handles all the unfamiliar error activity.  ]
h3 => [ 30) What is "Fatal Error/RDBMS Code 3996" error? ]
p => [ This error occurs while testing jobs in DataStage 8.5 during Teradata 13 to 14 upgrade. ]
p => [ It is because the user tries to assign a longer string to a shorter string destination, and sometimes if the length of one or more range boundaries in a RANGE_N function is a string literal with a length higher than that of the test value. ]
