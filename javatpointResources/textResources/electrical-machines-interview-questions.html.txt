h3 => [ 21) The series field winding has low resistance while the shunt field winding has high resistance. Why? ]
p => [ In the case of the generator, the series winding takes the full load current so, it requires very few turns to produce the necessary magnetic field, and therefore the series field winding has low resistance. But in the case of shunt winding the shunt resistance has full load voltage across it and requires a large number of turns to limit the current in it; therefore, the shunt field windings has high resistance.  ]
h3 => [ 22) What are the conditions to be satisfied for parallel operation of DC generators? ]
