p => [ IoT devices must be connected to the internet to work properly. These devices connect and communicate through their technical communication models. There are several ways to connect them to the internet for communication. An effective communication model is required for proper communication. Following is a list of different types of communication models used in IoT: ]
strong => [ Request-Response Communication Model ]
p => [ As the name specifies, the request-response communication model is based on the client making requests and the server responding to those requests. When the server receives a request, it decides what response to be provided. It fetches the requested data, prepares the response, and then sends it back to the client. This model does not retain the data between requests; therefore, each request is handled independently. That's why this is called a stateless model. ]
strong => [ Publisher-Subscriber Communication Model ]
p => [ In this communication model, publishers, brokers, and consumers are all involved in communication. Publishes are used as sources of data that send data to topics. The broker manages the topics, and consumers subscribe to the topics. Publishers and consumers are not directly related to each other. When the publisher receives the data for a topic, the broker forwards it to all subscribed consumers. It means brokers are responsible for receiving data from publishers and sending it to the appropriate consumers. ]
strong => [ Push-Pull Communication Model ]
p => [ The push-pull communication model ensures that data producers push the data into queues while consumers pull the data from the queues. In this communication model, neither producer nor consumer knows about each other, and it is the responsibility of the queue to decouple the messages between the consumers and the producers. Here, queues also act as a buffer if any mismatch is found between the rate at which producers push data and the rate at which consumers receive it. ]
strong => [ Exclusive-Pair Model ]
p => [ This is the most efficient model for quick communication. This is a full-duplex, bidirectional communication model developed for constant/continuous connections between a client and server. Once a connection is established, the clients and the servers can send and receive messages. As long as a client doesn't send a request to close the connection, the connection remains open. The server takes care of every open connection. ]
h3 => [ 15) What is the basic difference between an IoT device and a normal sensor device? ]
p => [ A normal sensor device does not need an active internet connection to work properly. On the other hand, IoT devices always require an active internet connection to work properly. ]
h3 => [ 16) What is the Bluegiga APX4 protocol? ]
p => [ The Bluegiga APX4 protocol is a solution based on a 450MHz ARM9 processor. It is used for communication in IoT devices as it supports both the WIFI and BLE platform. ]

h3 => [ 18) Explain the working of IoT? ]
p => [ IoT is based on Artificial Intelligence. The basic technology used in IoT devices is Artificial Intelligence. IoT contains multiple components like sensors, cloud components, data processing software, cutting-edge user interfaces, etc. In IoT systems, sensors connect the devices to the cloud. It uses Raspberry Pi equipped with a quad-core processor used as an "Internet gateway" for IoT devices. ]
p => [ Raspberry Pi is a card-sized computer that controls outputs with GIPO (general purpose input/output) pins. It collects data about real-world conditions using sensors. Sensors collect live data from the surrounding environment and send it to a cloud infrastructure. When the cloud receives the data, the software can process it and decide what action to take, such as sending an alert or automatically adjusting the sensors/devices without user intervention. ]
p => [ A user interface is required to check if user input is required or if they want to check in on the system. The user's adjustments are then sent inversely through the system to the cloud and from the cloud back to the sensors/devices to make changes. As a result, it thoroughly creates a highly reactive and intuitive device which increases the automation of the device. ]
h3 => [ 19) Why is PWM used in IoT? ]

These two pieces of metal are joined at one end, and the temperature is measured at a junction. A small voltage is generated by the metal conductors, which is interpreted to calculate the temperature. A thermocouple is a simple, robust, and economical temperature sensing device available in multiple types and sizes.
