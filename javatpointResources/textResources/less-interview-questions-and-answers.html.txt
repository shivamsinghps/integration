p => [ Following are the similarities between Less and Sass: ]
li => [ Namespaces are similar in both.  ]
li => [ Color functions are identical in both.  ]
li => [ Nesting capabilities are identical in both.  ]
li => [ JavaScript evaluations are identical in both. ]
h3 => [ 16) What is &amp;combinator in Less? ]
p => [ In LESS, &amp;combinator is used to combine the nested selector with the parent selector.  ]
h3 => [ 17) Does Less support operations? ]

After the compilation process, CSS file is created having font-size value 20px. ]
h3 => [ 26) What is commenting? ]
p => [ The commenting refers to some text which is understandable by the humans to understand the working of some complex codes in the programming. ]
h3 => [ 27) What is the reaction of the compiler to the comments? ]
p => [ The reaction of the compiler to the comments is nothing. The compiler ignores the comments at the time of compilation of the code. ]
h3 => [ 28) How many types of commenting can be done in the Less document? ]

h3 => [ 29) What is the use of importing in Less programming? How is it done? ]
p => [ The importing is used to import CSS or Less document into the Less document. Importing can be done by including "@import" followed by the address of the CSS or Less file at the beginning of the Less document. ]
h3 => [ 30) What is the use of extend in Less? ]

p => [ The list of different types of functions in Less is as follows: ]
li => [ Misc function ]
li => [ String functions ]
li => [ List function ]
li => [ Math function ]
li => [ Type function ]
li => [ Color definition function ]
li => [ Color channel function ]
li => [ Color operation ]
li => [ Color blending functions ]
