h2 => [ Questions Generally asked by the Interview Panel ]

You can say that it is one of the most prestigious government jobs in our country. We all know that an IAS officer is endowed with unmatched power. Even a state government cannot take action against IAS officials without taking permission from MHRD. Apart from being an attractive career option and benefits such as a good package and job security, civil services offer a platform for a candidate to serve the country at different levels, work for the underprivileged's welfare, and contribute towards the nation's development. But, it would help if you did not answer in such a simple and straightforward way. Your answer must be diplomatic and suits all the aspects. ]

blockquote => [ My basic reason of entering into civil services is to serve the nation, serve the people and to bring positive changes in the society. ]

p => [ However, you can answer this question by serving the nation, power and prestige associated with this job, being in a leadership position, various assignments, etc. ]
strong => [ You can answer this as follow: ]
p => [ IAS as a job I believe is best in India. This is a job where you don't think about salary. This job provides opportunities to serve in leadership and key positions in government. India is a developing and welfare-oriented nation, And IAS are involved in the formulation and implementation of national policies, which gives an IAS officer ample opportunity to problem-solving, innovating, and bringing ideas to life. Moreover, professional growth in IAS is rapid. They get a chance to serve in various departments of government.

li => [ I will eradicate poverty. ]
p => [ See, these statements are vague. You will get bashed in the interview if you won't be able to put up the fact and give back your statement logically. ]
p => [ So, you should always say meaningful things and always be ready to follow up questions. ]
p => [ If you don't know anything, then you can say I don't know. ]
p => [ Saying irrelevant things will lead one thing to another, and you will end up with a bad interview experience. They are really smart folks. Be simple nice genuine, and speak clearly. ]
h3 => [ 3) What is special about your date of birth? Any important event took place that year? ]
p => [  To answer this question, you must tell the historical or any other special facts associated with that date. For example, suppose you were born on  23rd April 1992.  Then you can say that- ]

strong => [ On 23rd April 1972, ]

h3 => [ 5) You have opted for arts subjects in UPSC when you are an engineer. Why did you choose that subject? ]
p => [ According to the recent trends, most engineering graduates choose their optional from humanities subjects in UPSC exams. The percentage of engineers is growing year by year who crack the UPSC exams. Engineering students crack the UPSC exam because of the practical pedagogical methods in their four-year engineering studies. This provides them with a better analytical aptitude as compared to Arts graduates. ]
p => [ Another big reason is that the brightest students in school are encouraged to take up Engineering or Medicine, and this is the same cadre of applicants that appear for UPSC. Because of these fields' very nature, engineering students understand competitive exams better than the Arts graduates. ]
h3 => [ 6) How can I select my subjects in UPSC if I am from an engineering background? ]
p => [ The subject selection for the UPSC exam depends on your choice. It doesn't matter from which background you are. For the civil service exam (IAS/IFS/IPS), you have to choose only one optional, and for IFoS, you have to choose 2. If you are an engineering graduate, Mathematics will be a good optional for which you might have the pre-requisite knowledge. But you should select Mathematics only if you have an interest in that subject. Always remember that coaching for Mathematics is not widely available compared to other subjects. If you think you can prepare the subject by yourself only then opt for it. ]
p => [ If you don't feel confident in Mathematics, you should focus on the big four art subjects (History, Geography, Polity, and Economics). ]
p => [ Select one subject you find interesting, and feel the confidence you can write the answers, refer to previous year question papers. The biggest advantages of these subjects are that you can find many trainers and study materials who can guide you. Find someone who can guide you. It can be any coaching institute or anyone from your friends or family. ]
p => [ Besides these subjects, Public Administration is also a good choice. Don't go for engineering subjects like Mechanical, Civil or Electrical if you don't feel confident. These subjects are lengthy, took a lot of time. ]
h4 => [ Note: Choose your optional only on your interest. Remember your optional subject is a very crucial factor to get you in the final list. ]
h3 => [ 7) How to choose the optional subject for UPSC Civil Services Exam? ]
p => [ Many aspects should be kept in mind while choosing an Optional Subject for the UPSC exam: ]
strong => [ 1. Interest and academic background of the aspirant ]
p => [ Before choosing your Optional, you should identify your interest in a subject. Go through school level NCERT's (Class 11th and 12th preferably), and check the Optional subject syllabus and your comfort level in reading the subject. ]
strong => [ For example: ]
p => [  (a)  If you are from the Commerce background, look for what you have already studied in college and choose accordingly between Commerce, Management or Public Administration. ]
p => [  (b)  If you are from an Engineering background, check the syllabus and content of optional subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Engineering optional - Civil, Electrical, Mechanical etc. If you are not comfortable with the science subjects mentioned, check other optional subjects such as Geography, Psychology, Anthropology, Political Science, Sociology, Public Administration, Philosophy etc. ]
strong => [ 2. Coaching and Trainers available for the subject ]
p => [ You can talk to your seniors, friends, and civil servants who have already qualified to identify the best coaching classes available in your city. Study material from good coaching, along with the classes conducted, can accelerate your preparation. ]
strong => [ 3. Contribution of the Optional Subject towards General Study syllabus ]
p => [ This point is very important, and that's why many aspirants take humanities subjects as their optional because they cover a good part of the general study. ]
strong => [ 4. Performance of the optional subject in the recent past (at least past three years) ]
p => [ The individual performance of a candidate can vary on a large number of parameters compared to his competitors. You can find that some optional subjects do not fetch the marks desired compared to the effort put in by candidates. You should avoid those subjects. ]
strong => [ 5. Time Management ]
p => [ Time management is the biggest factor to be selected in the UPSC exam. The candidate should decide how much time he/she would spend studying an Optional Subject. A few candidates might be working while preparing or studying at a university.
