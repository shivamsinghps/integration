h1 => [ Top 40 Most Asked Weblogic Interview Questions and Answers ]
h3 => [ 1) What is the WebLogic server, and what are its main usages? ]
p => [ WebLogic Server is a Java-based Java EE application server currently developed and managed by Oracle Corporation. That's why it is also called Oracle WebLogic Server. The Oracle organization acquired WebLogic Server when it purchased BEA Systems in 2008. The Oracle WebLogic Server is a unified and extensible platform for developing, deploying, and running enterprise applications, such as Java, on-premises, and in the cloud. ]
p => [ It can host Java-based applications. It provides a robust, mature, and scalable implementation of Java Enterprise Edition (EE) and Jakarta EE. Web applications and Enterprise applications that are developed can be deployed in a WebLogic server to serve the business logic. In Layman's words, we can say that, with a WebLogic server, we can easily deploy, distribute, and run Java-based applications. ]
h3 => [ 2) What do you understand by deployment descriptors? ]
p => [ In Oracle WebLogic Server, the deployment descriptors are associated with almost all the modules and applications. We can see the deployment descriptors in the form of XML documents. They are mainly used to describe the contents that are part of the directory or the jar file. J2EE specifications usually define the standard and the deployment descriptors that are portable for J2EE applications and modules. ]

h3 => [ 6) What is a domain in an Oracle WebLogic server? ]
p => [ In the Oracle WebLogic server, domains are the logical set of resources that individually constitutes a single unit. In other words, domains are the logically related groups of Oracle WebLogic Server resources that are managed as a single unit. ]
p => [ A domain provides one point of administration. It contains a special Oracle WebLogic server instance known as Administration Server, which can be used to configure and manage all resources in that specific domain. A domain can logically separate development, test, production applications, and organizational divisions. ]
h3 => [ 7) What do you understand by a Server? ]
p => [ Oracle WebLogic Server is an application server. It is a unified and extensible platform for developing and deploying multitier distributed enterprise applications and running enterprise applications, such as Java, for on-premises and in the cloud. ]
p => [ WebLogic Server provides a robust, mature, and scalable implementation of Java Enterprise Edition (EE) and Jakarta EE. ]

strong => [ There are mainly two types of Oracle WebLogic Servers: ]
li => [ Administration or Admin Server ]
li => [ Managed Server ]
h3 => [ 8) What do you understand by the Admin Server in Oracle WebLogic Servers? ]
p => [ The Administration Server or Admin Server is a certain category of Oracle WebLogic Servers. It provides a central point for managing a WebLogic Server domain. Except for this type of server, all other WebLogic Server instances in a domain are called Managed Servers. As the Admin Server is the central domain configuration interface, it is used to create, delete and configure the resources of a domain like managed server, machine, cluster, data source, work managers, etc. ]
p => [ If a domain has only a single WebLogic Server instance, it works as both the Administration Server and the Managed Server. ]
h3 => [ 9) What is the Managed Server in Oracle WebLogic Servers? ]
p => [ The Managed Server is an instance of the WebLogic server that runs on JVM and has its configuration. We deploy the java components such as Web Applications, EJB Applications, JMS Applications, and Web services in the managed server. The managed server contacts the administration server for configuration information. It runs the business application in a production environment. It does not depend on any other managed servers in a domain unless they are not in a cluster. We can have many managed servers in a domain. Generally, a single domain can have zero to N Managed Server. ]
p => [ Server instances other than the Administration Server are called Managed Servers in a domain. The Managed Servers in a domain can start-up independently of the Administration Server if the Administration Server is unavailable. We can configure two or more Managed Servers as a WebLogic Server cluster to increase the application scalability and availability. ]
h3 => [ 10) What do you understand by web.xml in the WebLogic server? ]
p => [ The web.xml is an XML document mainly used for application purposes. It is very useful and helps list out the J2EE components and configuration of the application in J2EE modules format. ]
h3 => [ 11) Is WebLogic Server an Application Server or a Web Server? ]
p => [ The WebLogic Server is an application server. It is a platform used to develop and deploy multitier distributed enterprise applications. ]
strong => [ Some important features of WebLogic Server: ]
li => [ The WebLogic Server is operated in the middle tier of a multitier or n-tier architecture. ]
li => [ Due to its multitier architecture, we can choose the best location for each software component, which can help develop applications faster, ease deployment and administration, and provide greater control over performance, utilization, security, scalability, and reliability. ]
li => [ It centralizes application services such as Web server functionality and business components and is used to access backend enterprise systems. ]
li => [ It uses caching and connection pooling technologies to improve resource use and application performance. ]
li => [ It also provides enterprise-level security and powerful administration facilities.  ]
li => [ The WebLogic server can host both Web applications and Enterprise applications (such as EJBs).  ]
li => [ It implements J2EE, the Java Enterprise standard. ]
h3 => [ 12) What are the different thread states in a WebLogic server? ]
p => [ Following is a list of several thread states used in a WebLogic server: ]
li => [ ACTIVE ]
li => [ IDLE ]
li => [ STUCK ]
li => [ HOGGER ]
li => [ STANDBY ]
h3 => [ 13) What methods can be used to provide user credentials for starting the server? ]
p => [ When the domain is created, the wizard for setting configuration asks for the details, like user name, password, etc., from the user who is logging in for the first time as the administrator. If you have created the domain in development mode, the configuration wizard saves the encrypted password and the username inside the identity file. When the system is booting, this file is available for reference so that in the absence of this file, the system can prompt the user so that it can enter the credentials. A new boot named "identity file" can be created if you want to change the user credentials or if you have the requirement of creating a domain in production mode. ]
h3 => [ 14) What would happen if the Administration Server fails? ]
p => [ If the Administration Server fails for a domain, it does not affect the operation of Managed Servers in the domain. If an Administration Server for a domain becomes unavailable while the server instances it manages (clustered or otherwise) are up and running, those Managed Servers continue to run. If the domain contains clustered server instances, the load balancing and failover capabilities supported by the domain configuration remain available, even if the Administration Server fails. In this case, if the Administration Server stops running while the Managed Servers in the domain continue to run, then each Managed Server periodically attempts to reconnect to the Administration Server. ]
p => [ If the system faces any hardware or software failure on its host machine, and if the Administration Server fails, then the other server instances on the same machine may be similarly affected. But, if the Administration Server fails, it does not interrupt the operation of Managed Servers in the domain. You can start a Managed Server even if the Administration Server is not running. In this case, the Managed Server uses a local copy of its configuration files for its starting configuration and then periodically attempts to connect with the Administration Server. In this case, if the connection doesn't occur, it synchronizes its configuration state with the Administration Server.  ]
h3 => [ 14) What are the different supported installation modes available for WebLogic Server? ]
p => [ Following are the three supported installation modes available for WebLogic Server: ]
strong => [ Console mode:  ]
strong => [ Graphical mode:  ]
strong => [ Silent mode:  ]
h3 => [ 16) What is the use of HTTP? ]
p => [ HTTP is a protocol that enables the communication between the WebLogic server and processes. ]
h3 => [ 17) What are the key differences between the stage and the non-stage deployments in Weblogic Server? ]
p => [ The stage deployment is a process where the Admin receives a copy which is later distributed amongst the available instances. On the other hand, the Non-Stage deployment provides a restriction that each instance needs to contact the source for the necessary deployments. ]
h3 => [ 18) How many ways can we provide credentials to start the WebLogic server? ]
