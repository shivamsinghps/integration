h1 => [ Informatica interview questions ]
p => [  A list of top frequently asked  Informatica Interview Questions  and answers are given below. ]
h3 => [ 1) What is Informatica? Why do we need it? ]
p => [ Informatica is a software development firm founded in 1993 by Gaurav Dhillon and Diaz Nesamoney. Informatica is an ETL tool that offers data integration solutions. ETL tools are the tools used to extract, transform, and load the data. Therefore, we can say that Informatica is an ETL tool used to extract the data from one database and stores it in another database.  ]
strong => [ Extract ]
strong => [ Transform ]
strong => [ Load ]
h3 => [ 2) What are the popular Informatica products? ]
p => [ The following are the popular Informatica products: ]
li => [ Power Center ]
li => [ Power Mart ]
li => [ Power Exchange ]
li => [ Power Center Connect ]
li => [ Power Channel ]
li => [ Metadata Exchange ]
li => [ Power Analyzer ]
li => [ Super Glue ]
h3 => [ 3) What is Informatica PowerCenter? ]
p => [ Informatica PowerCenter is an ETL tool used to build the enterprise data warehouses. It is highly available, fully-scalable, and high performing tool. ]
p => [ It provides reliable solutions to the IT management team as it delivers not only data to meet the operational and analytical requirements of the business, but also supports various data integration projects ]
h3 => [ 4) What is a data warehouse? ]
li => [ The data warehouse is a technique of integrating data from multiple sources. It involves analytical reporting, data integration, data cleaning, and data consolidations. ]
li => [ A data warehouse is mainly designed for query and data analysis purpose instead of transaction processing. ]
li => [ It is used to transform the information into useful data whenever the user required. ]
li => [ The data warehouse is an environment, not a product that provides the current and historical decision support information to the users, which is not possible to access the traditional operational database. ]
li => [ The data which is processed and transformed in the data warehouse can be accessed by using the Business Intelligence tools, SQL Clients, and spreadsheets.  ]
h3 => [ 5) How can Informatica be used for an organization? ]
p => [ Informatica in an organization can be used in the following ways: ]
strong => [ Data Migration ]
strong => [ Data Warehousing ]
strong => [ Data Integration ]
h3 => [ 6) Explain the Informatica workflow? ]
p => [ Informatica workflow is a collection of tasks which are connected with the starting task and triggers the proper sequence to execute the process. ]
p => [ Workflow is created either manually or automatically by using the workflow designer tool. ]
h3 => [ 7) Mention some types of transformation? ]
h3 => [ 8) What is the difference between active and passive transformation? ]
p => [ An active transformation is a transformation that changes the number of rows when the source table is passed through it. For example, Aggregator transformation is a type of active transformation that performs the aggregations on groups such as sum and reduces the number of rows. ]
p => [ A passive transformation is a transformation that does not change the number of rows when the source data is passed through it, i.e., neither the new rows are added, nor existing rows are dropped. In this transformation, the number of output and input rows are the same.  ]
h3 => [ 9) Explain the difference between a data warehouse and a data mart? ]
p => [ Data warehouse and Data mart are the structured repositories that store and manage the data. A data warehouse is used to store the data centrally for the entire business while data mart is used to store the specific data, not the entire business data. Querying the data from the data warehouse is a very tedious task, so data mart is used. The data mart is a collection of smaller sets of data which allows you to access the data faster and efficiently. ]
h3 => [ 10) What is repository manager? ]
p => [ A repository is a place or a relational database used to store the information or metadata. Metadata can include various information such as mappings that describes how to transform the data, sessions describe when you want the Informatica server to perform the transformations, also stores the administrative information such username and password, permissions and privileges, and product version. The repository is created and maintained by the Repository Manager client tool. ]
p => [ Repository Manager is a manager that manages and organizes the repository. Repository Manager can create the folders to organize the data and groups to handle multiple users. ]
h3 => [ 11) What is mapping? ]
p => [ Mapping is a pipeline or structural flow of data that describes how data flows from source to the destination through transformations. ]
p => [ Mapping consists of the following components: ]
strong => [ Source Definition ]
strong => [ Target Definition ]
strong => [ Transformation ]
strong => [ Links ]
h3 => [ 12) What is session? ]
li => [ A session is a property in Informatica that have a set of instructions to define when and how to move the data from the source table to the target table. ]
li => [ A session is like a task that we create in workflow manager. Any session that you create must have a mapping associated with it. ]
li => [ Session must have a single mapping at a time, and it cannot be changed.  ]
li => [ In order to execute the session, it must be added to the workflow. ]
li => [ A session can either be a reusable or non-reusable object where reusable means that we can use the data for multiple rows. ]
h3 => [ 13) What is Designer? ]
p => [ A designer is a graphical user interface that builds and manage the objects like source table, target table, Mapplets, Mappings, and transformations. ]
p => [ Mapping in Designer is created by using the Source Analyzer to import the source table, and target designer is used to import the target table. ]
strong => [ Designer components: ]
p => [ Designer contains multiple components: ]
strong => [ Navigator ]
strong => [ Navigator is used to perform the following activities: ]
li => [ It is used to connect with Repository service. ]
li => [ It is used to open folders. ]
li => [ It is used to copy objects and to create the shortcuts. ]

strong => [ Toolbar ]
strong => [ Output/Control panel ]
strong => [ Status bar ]
h3 => [ 14) What is domain? ]
li => [ The domain is a collection of nodes (machines) and services, i.e., repository service, integration service, nodes, etc.  ]
li => [ It is an administrative unit from where you manage or control things such as configurations, users, security. ]
li => [ The domain is an environment where you can have a single domain as well as multiple domains. For example, we have three departments such as development, test, and production; then we will have a domain for each department, i.e., we have three domains. ]
h3 => [ 15) What is Workflow Manager? ]
p => [ Workflow Manager is used to create Workflow and Worklet. ]
strong => [ Workflow ]
li => [ Workflow is a set of instructions used to execute the mappings. ]
li => [ The workflow contains various tasks such as session task, command task, event wait task, email task, etc. which are used to execute the sessions. ]
li => [ It is also used to schedule the mappings. ]
li => [ All the tasks are connected to each other through links inside a workflow. ]
li => [ After creating the workflow, we can execute the workflow in the workflow manager and monitor its progress through the workflow monitor. ]
strong => [ Worklet ]
li => [ Worklet is an object that groups a set of tasks which can be reused in multiple workflows. ]
li => [ A worklet is similar to a workflow, but it does not have any scheduling information. ]
li => [ In worklet, you can group the tasks in a single place so that it can be easily identified. ]
h3 => [ 16) What is Workflow Monitor? ]
p => [ Workflow Monitor is used to monitor the execution of workflows or the tasks available in the workflow. It is mainly used to monitor the progress of activities such as Event log information, a list of executed workflows, and their execution time.  ]
strong => [ Workflow Monitor can be used to perform the following activities: ]
li => [ You can see the details of execution ]
li => [ You can see the history of workflow execution ]
li => [ You can stop, abort, or restart the workflows. ]

strong => [ It consists of the following windows: ]
strong => [ Navigator window ]
strong => [ Output window ]
strong => [ Time window ]
strong => [ Gantt Chart view ]
strong => [ Task view ]
h3 => [ 17) Explain the types of transformations? ]
p => [ Transformations are used to transform the source data into target data. It ensures that the data will be loaded to the target database based on the requirements of the target system. ]
p => [ A transformation is basically a repository object that can read, modify, and passes the data from source to the target. ]
strong => [ There are two types of transformations: ]
strong => [ Active transformation ]
strong => [ Passive transformation ]
h3 => [ 18) What is SQ transformation? ]
strong => [ Source Qualifier transformation ]
strong => [ active and connected ]
li => [ When you add the source tables in mapping, then Source Qualifier is added automatically. ]
li => [ It displays the transformation types, i.e., it converts the source datatypes into an Informatica compatible datatypes. ]
li => [ In the case of SQ transformation datatypes, source datatype does not match with the Informatica compatible datatype then the mapping will become invalid when you save it. ]
li => [ SQ transformation is an active transformation as you can apply all the business rules and filters to overcome the performance issue. ]
li => [ By using SQ transformation, you can apply filters on the data by applying joins on the tables. ]
li => [ Source Qualifier transformation can also join homogeneous tables, i.e., data originating from the same database into a single SQ transformation. ]
strong => [ Following are the properties of SQ transformation: ]
li => [ User Defined SQL Query ]
li => [ User Defined Joins ]
li => [ Add/Modify WHERE clause using Filter ]
li => [ Add/Modify ORDER BY sorted ports ]
li => [ Select Unique/Distinct rows ]
h3 => [ 19) What is an Expression Transformation? ]
li => [ Expression Transformation is a passive and connected transformation. ]
li => [ It is used to manipulate the values in a single row. ]
li => [ Examples of expression transformation are concatenating the first name and last name, adjusting the student records, converting strings to date, etc. ]
li => [ It also checks the conditional statements before passing the data to other transformations. ]
li => [ Expression transformation uses numeric and logical operators ]
strong => [ Following are the operations performed by the expression transformer are: ]
strong => [ Data manipulation ]
strong => [ Datatype conversion ]
strong => [ Data cleansing ]

h3 => [ 20) What is a Sorter Transformation? ]
li => [ It is an active and connected transformation. ]
li => [ It is used to sort the data either in ascending or in descending order, similar to the ORDER BY clause in SQL. ]
li => [ It is also used in case-sensitive sorting, and also used to specify whether the output rows should be distinct or not. ]
li => [ Sorter transformation is an active transformation as it eliminates duplicates. ]
strong => [ Properties of Sorter Transformation: ]

strong => [ Components of Aggregator transformation: ]
strong => [ Aggregate cache ]
strong => [ Aggregate expression ]
strong => [ Group by port ]
strong => [ Sorted input ]
h3 => [ 22) What is a Filter Transformation? ]
li => [ Filter transformation is an active and connected transformation. ]
li => [ It filters out the rows which are passed through it, i.e., it changes the number of rows which are passed through. ]
li => [ It applies the filter condition on the group of data. This filter condition returns an either true or false value. If the value is true means that the condition is satisfied, then data is passed through, and if the value is false means that the filter condition is not satisfied, then integration service drops the data and writes the message to the session log. ]
h3 => [ 23) What is a Joiner Transformation? ]
li => [ Joiner Transformation is an active and connected transformation. ]
li => [ It allows you to create the joins in Informatica, similar to the joins that we create in database. ]
li => [ Master source ]
li => [ Detail source ]
p => [ In joiner transformation, you need to choose which data source will be Master, and which data source will be Detail. ]
strong => [ There are four types of joins used in a joiner transformation: ]
strong => [ Master outer join ]
strong => [ Detail outer join ]
strong => [ Full outer join ]
strong => [ Normal join ]
h3 => [ 24) What is a Router Transformation? ]
li => [ Router transformation is an active and connected transformation. ]
li => [ Router transformation is similar to the filter transformation as both the transformations test the input data based on the filters. ]
li => [ In Filter transformation, you can apply only one filter or condition, and if the condition is not satisfied, then a particular is dropped. But in Router transformation, more than one condition can be applied. Therefore, we can say that the single input data can be checked on multiple conditions. ]
h3 => [ 25) What is Rank Transform? ]
li => [ Rank transformation is an active and connected transformation. ]
li => [ It filters the data based on groups and ranks. ]
li => [ For example, if you want to get top 3 salaried employees department wise, then this will be achieved by the rank transformation. ]
li => [ Rank transform contains an output port which assigns a rank to the rows. ]
h3 => [ 26) What is a Sequence Generator Transformation? ]
li => [ Sequence Generator transformation is a passive and connected transformation. ]
li => [ It is a type of transformation that generates numeric values. ]
li => [ It creates unique primary key values, replaces missing primary keys, or cycle through a sequential range of numbers. ]
h3 => [ 27) What is a Stored Procedure Transformation? ]
li => [ It is a passive transformation. ]
li => [ It can be used in both connected and unconnected mode. ]
li => [ Informatica contains the stored procedure transformation which is used to run the stored procedures in the database where stored procedures are pre-compiled PL-SQL statements, and these pre-compiled statements are executed using Execute or Call statements. ]
strong => [ There are three types of data that can be passed between the integration service and stored procedure: ]
strong => [ Input/Output parameters ]
strong => [ Return values ]
strong => [ Status codes ]
h3 => [ 28) What is lookup Transformation? ]
li => [ Lookup transformation is active as well as passive transformation. ]
li => [ It can be used in both connected and unconnected mode. ]
li => [ It is used to look up the data in a source, source qualifier, flat file, or a relational table to retrieve the data. ]
li => [ We can import the definition of lookup from any flat file or relational database, and an integration service queries the lookup source based on the ports, lookup condition and then returns the result to other transformations.  ]
strong => [ Lookup transformation can be in two modes: ]
strong => [ Lookup table ]
strong => [ Lookup condition ]
strong => [ The following are the activities performed by the lookup transformation: ]
strong => [ Get a Related value ]
strong => [ Get multiple values ]
strong => [ Perform a calculation ]
strong => [ Update slowly changing dimension tables ]
h3 => [ 29) What is Union transformation? ]
li => [ Union transformation is an active transformation. ]
li => [ It is similar to the SQL Union All, i.e., it combines the data from the multiple files and produces the single output and then store it in the target table. ]
strong => [ Guidelines of Union transformation ]
li => [ Union transformation contains multiple output groups, but one input group. ]
strong => [ select distinct ]
li => [ It does not generate any transaction. ]
li => [ You cannot connect to a sequence generator transformation to generate the sequences. ]
h3 => [ 30) What is Update Strategy transform? ]
li => [ It is an active and connected transformation. ]
li => [ This type of transformation can be used to insert, update, or delete the records from the target table. ]
li => [ It can even reject all the records to avoid reaching to the target table ]
p => [ The design of the target table depends on how the changes are made in the existing row. An update strategy transform works in two levels: ]
strong => [ Session level ]
strong => [ Mapping level ]
h3 => [ 31) What are the tasks that can be performed using SQ? ]
strong => [ The following are the tasks performed by using SQ: ]
