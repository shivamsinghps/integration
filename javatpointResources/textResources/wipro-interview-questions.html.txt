span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  a ]
p => [  Explanation:   
Suppose the number of inlet pipes is A, and the number of outlet pipes is B 
A / 12 - B / 8 = 1/12 
2B - 3B = 2 
let's take A = 4 and B = 2. Then the condition will be full-filled.

li => [ 15 hours ]
li => [ 8 hours ]
li => [ 12 hours ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  b ]
p => [  Explanation:   
If a is the speed then speed of X= a + 5 and Y = a 
Time taken by A and B will be a and a + 5 resp. 
1/a + 1/a + 5 = 1/6 ; a2 - 7a - 30 = 0  
x = -3 or x = 10. 
Time can't be negative, i.e., x =10. 
Hence the pipe  X can fill the reservoir in 10 hours, and Y can fill it in 10+5=15 hours . ]

He in total gets 20% profit by selling the first two, and at last, he finds that he has no loss or no gain in selling the whole quantity which he had. Calculate the percentage of loss that he suffered for the third quantity? ]
li => [ 30% ]
li => [ 40% ]
li => [ 20% ]
li => [ 50% ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  b ]
p => [  Explanation:   
Total Money spent by dealer: 
(24 * 200 + 30 * 160 + 40 * 120) = 14400 
For first 2 quantity, (24 * 200) + (30 * 160) = 9600 
He gets 20% profit by selling first two items= 1920,  
The total amount will be 9600+1920=11520 
so the third quantity = 14400 - 11520 = 2880 
Actual third quantity rate = 40 * 120 = 4800 
Loss suffered = (4800 - 2880) / 4800 
= 1920/4800 =  40 % ]
h2 => [ 7) A boat takes 38 hours for traveling downstream from point X to point Y and coming back to a point Z midway between X and Y. If the stream velocity is 4km/h and the boat speed in still water is 14 km/h, find the distance between X and Y? ]

li => [ 360 km ]
li => [ 260 km ]
li => [ 220 km ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  b ]
p => [  Explanation:   
Boat Speed for downstream = 14 + 4 = 18 km/hr 
Boat speed for upstream = 14 - 4 = 10 km/hr 
Distance = x 
x / 18 + (x /2)/10 = 38 
 x = 360 km ]
h2 => [ 8) The speed of a boat is 8 km/h in still water, and the speed of the current is 4 km/h. If the time taken to reach a certain distance upstream is 18 hours, the time it will take to go the same distance downstream is ]
li => [ 3.5 hours ]
li => [ 6.5 hours ]
li => [ 6 hours ]
li => [ 3 hours ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  c ]
p => [  Explanation:   
Upstream speed of a boat = 8 - 4 = 4 km/hr 
downstream speed of a boat = 8 + 4 = 12 km/hr 
suppose the distance = x 
Then for Upstream case: x / 4 = 18. Hence, x = 72 km 
Now the time taken to go the same distance downstream: Time = 72/12 = 6 hrs ]
h2 => [ 9) A man can swim 10.5 km/h in still water, and he finds that it takes him twice as long to swim up as to swim down the river. The speed of the stream is ]
li => [ 2.5 km/h ]
li => [ 3.5 km/h ]
li => [ 1.75 km/h ]
li => [ 2 km/h ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  b ]
p => [  Explanation:   
Let the speed of stream be N.
Then for downstream, 10.5 + N = D 
and for upstream, 10.5 - N = U 
so we get, D + U = 21 
But, it takes him double as long to swim up as to swim down the river. 
2U+	U = 21; U = 7. Thus, 10.5 - N = 7 
S=3.5 km/h ]

h3 => [ 8) What are Multi-Processing and Multitasking? ]
p => [  Multitasking : As the name indicates multiple tasks run on a single CPU. We use multitasking to utilize the CPU. ]
strong => [ Multitasking can be achieved in two ways: ]
li => [ Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing) ]
li => [ Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading) ]
p => [  Multi-processing : Multi-processing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one central processing unit at the same time.  ]
p => [  Multithreading : As the name indicates multiple threads run concurrently.  ]
p => [ A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. ]
h3 => [ 9) What are stack and Queue and its applications? ]
h3 => [ Stack ]
strong => [ top ]
li => [ The stack is a recursive data structure having a pointer to its top element. ]
li => [ Stacks are sometimes called as Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) lists, i.e., the element which is inserted first in the stack will be deleted last from the stack. ]
strong => [ Applications of Stack: ]
li => [ Recursion ]
li => [ Expression evaluations and conversions ]
li => [ Parsing ]
li => [ Browsers ]
li => [ Editors ]
li => [ Tree Traversals ]
h3 => [ Queue ]
strong => [ REAR ]
li => [ The queue is referred to be as the First-In-First-Out list. ]
li => [ For example, people waiting in line for a rail ticket form a queue. ]
strong => [ Applications of Queue: ]
li => [ The queues are widely used as waiting lists for a single shared resource like a printer, disk, CPU. ]
li => [ The queues are used in the asynchronous transfer of data (where data is not being transferred at the same rate between two processes), e.g., Pipes, file IO, sockets. ]
li => [ The queues are used as buffers in most of the applications like MP3 media player, CD player, etc. ]
li => [ The queues are used to maintain the playlist in media players to add and remove the songs from the playlist. ]
li => [ The queues are used in operating systems for handling interrupts. ]
h3 => [ 10) What is indexing, what are the advantages and disadvantages of it? ]
p => [ Indexes are special lookup tables. It is used to retrieve data from the database very fast. ]
p => [ An Index is used to speed up select queries and where clauses. But it shows down the data input with insert and update statements. Without affecting the data, we can create or drop indexes ]
p => [ An index in a database is just like an index in the back of a book. ]
p => [ Indexing can be of the following types  ]
p => [ Primary index, secondary index, and clustering index. ]
strong => [ The advantages of indexes are as follows: ]
li => [ An index makes it possible to retrieve data quickly. ]
li => [ Index's use in queries usually results in much better performance. ]
li => [ They can be used for sorting. A post-fetch-sort operation can be eliminated. ]
li => [ Index guarantees uniquely identifiable records in the database. ]
strong => [ The disadvantages of indexes are as follows: ]
li => [ Indexes decrease the performance on inserts, updates, and deletes. ]
li => [ Indexes take up space (this increase with the number of fields used and the length of the fields). ]
li => [ Databases will have monocase values in fields that are indexed. ]
h3 => [ 11) What is De-Normalization where does it have? ]
p => [  Denormalization is the process of boosting up database performance and adding of redundant data which helps to get rid of complex data. Denormalization is a part of database optimization technique.  This process is used to avoid the use of complex and costly joins . ]
p => [ Denormalization doesn't refer to the thought of not to normalize instead of that denormalization takes place after normalization. In this process, firstly the redundancy of the data will be removed using normalization process than through denormalization process we will add redundant data as per the requirement so that we can easily avoid the costly joins. ]
h3 => [ 12) What are the Different Objects in DBMS? ]
p => [ A database objects use to store or reference data in the database. Any statement which is written with CREATE Command is known as the database object. ]
p => [ Different types of object in DBMS are: ]
p => [  View : This object is used to create a view in the database. It is a logical table based on another view. A table on which view is based is called the base table.  ]
p => [  Table : we can create a table in a database by using the CREATE TABLE statement. ]
p => [  Sequence : This object command used to create a sequence in the database. It is a user-created database object which is shared by multiple users to generate unique integers. ]
p => [  Index : A database object can create indexes in the database by using an index. Indexes are used for fast retrieval of rows from a table. ]
p => [  Synonym : This object is also used for creating indexes in the database. By synonym, you can easily access the objects ]
h3 => [ 13) What are Self-Join and Outer Join, where do you use it? ]
p => [  Self-Join : A self-join is a join which joins the table with itself, means that each row of the table is combined with itself and with every other row of the table. The table contains a FOREIGN KEY which references its PRIMARY KEY. ]
p => [ It shows the one-to-many relationship in a table also known as a unary relationship. ]
p => [  Now come to SQL outer join , all the content of both tables is integrated together either they are matched or not. ]
p => [  An outer join is of two types : ]
p => [  1. Left outer join  (also known as left join): this join returns all the rows from left table combine with the matching rows of the right table. If you get no matching in the right table, it returns NULL values. ]
strong => [ Syntax: Left outer join ]
strong => [ SELECT ]
strong => [ FROM ]
li => [ LEFTJOIN table2  ]
strong => [ ON ]
p => [  2. Right outer join  (also known as right join): this join returns all the rows from right table are combined with the matching rows of left table .If you get no column matching in the left table .it returns null value. ]

h3 => [ 15) Explain some differences between TRUNCATE and DELETE commands with their syntax? ]
p => [  There is a slight difference b/w delete and truncate statement. The  DELETE statement  only removes the rows from the table based on the condition defined by WHERE clause or remove all the rows from the table when the condition is not specified. ]
p => [  But it does not free the space containing by the table . ]
strong => [ Syntax: ]
p => [ But if you do not specify the WHERE condition, it will remove all the rows from the table. ]
p => [  The  TRUNCATE statement : It is used to delete all the rows from the table  and free the containing space . ]
strong => [ Syntax: ]
h3 => [ 16) Define memory management in C. ]
p => [ When you run a program, it loads into your computer memory and starts execution by sending and receiving the instructions from the computer's processor. When your program needs to run a function, then it loads at another part of the memory till it runs and releases that memory when the task is complete. ]
p => [  Now, talk about the concept of  dynamic memory allocation in c language, which  enables the C programmer to allocate memory at runtime. Dynamic memory allocation in c language is possible by four functions of stdlib.h header file. ]

p => [ An Interface can extend interface only; Abstract class have two properties, it can extend only one java class but implement more than one interface at a time. ]
h3 => [ 19) What is the property of a class? ]
p => [ We can define property in a way that property is a member of a class that provides the access of an object or a class to an attribute. For e.g., Properties include the length of a string, the size of a font, the caption of a window, the name of a customer, and so on. ]
h3 => [ 20) Define precondition and postcondition to a member function. ]

strong => [ method overriding ]
h3 => [ 31) How is C++ struct different from C++ class? ]
p => [  A struct is a  bundle . It is a combination of all related elements that need to work together in a particular context. Such as, the restricted number of arguments context can pass to a function: ]
p => [ If you don't specify the access modifier, visibility (public, private or protected) of the members will be public in the struct and private in the class.  ]
p => [ The visibility by default goes just a little further than members: for inheritance, if you don't specify anything then the struct will inherit publicly from its base class, while the class will do private inheritance: ]
h3 => [ 32) What is DOM? ]
p => [ DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming API for the HTML and XML documents. DOM provides the logical structure of the document and the way in which a document is accessed and manipulated. ]
p => [ DOM represents a table in the hierarchical form. ]
h3 => [ 33) Specify the characters which can be used as the second character of an identifier, but not as the first character of an identifier? ]

strong => [ List Iteration ]
strong => [ Range-view ]
strong => [ List Interface declaration ]
h3 => [ 35) What Is The Vector Class? ]
p => [ Vector implements List interface and maintains insertion order. Array list and vector class both are similar but with few differences. ]
p => [  Vector is synchronized : Vector is  slow  because it is synchronized, i.e., in multithreading environment; it will hold the other threads in runnable or non-runnable state until current thread releases the lock of the object. ]
strong => [ Vector is a legacy class ]
p => [ Vector increments 100% means doubles the array size if the total number of elements exceeds than its capacity. ]

h3 => [ 39) What is garbage collection? Does it guarantee that a program will not run out of memory? ]
strong => [ Garbage collection: ]
p => [ Garbage Collection is a process of reclaiming the unused runtime memory automatically. i.e., it is a way to destroy the unused objects. ]
p => [ To do so, we were using free () function in the C language and delete () in C++. But, in Java, it is performed automatically. So, java provides better memory management. ]
p => [ In some cases, programs use up memory resources faster than they are garbage collected. We can also create objects "without new keyword" in programs that are not subject to garbage collection. That's why garbage collection doesn't guarantee that a program will not run out of memory. ]

p => [ Order of precedence is used with the operators. When a number of operators are used in an expression, it evaluates with the priority of the operators. ]
p => [ Associativity is used to check whether an expression is evaluated from left-to-right or right-to-left. ]
strong => [ Order of precedence example:  ]
p => [ The given expression is equivalent to: ]
p => [  The expression (2 + 5) will executes first and the result will be 7 
Then after first part of the expression (5 &gt; 7) executes and gives 0 (false) as an output 
Finally, (0 &amp;&amp; 4) executes and gives 0 (false). ]
strong => [ Associativity:  ]
p => [ Here, operators * and / have the same precedence. Both "*" and "/" are left to right associative, i.e., the expression on the left is executed first and moves towards the right. ]
p => [ Thus, the expression above is equivalent to: ]
h3 => [ 53) What is the rule for a catch or declare method declarations? ]
p => [ Catch block catches any exception that results from the try block. If a checked exception is thrown within the body of the method, the thrown exception must be caught by the method (with the help of try/catch block) or declare it in its throws clause. ]

h3 => [ 59) What is a priority of task and how is it used in scheduling? ]
p => [ The entire task can't execute simultaneously so that a scheduler assign priorities to all tasks for its execution. Priorities can be high or low depending on the task's importance, and the integer values determine it.  ]
p => [ Higher priority gets CPU for execution first.  ]
h3 => [ 60) Describe the three levels of data abstraction? ]
p => [  Data abstraction in DBMS  is a process of hiding irrelevant details from users. Because database systems are made of complex data structures, so it makes accessible the user interaction with the database. ]
strong => [ Following are three levels of data abstraction: ]
p => [  Physical level:  It is the lowest level of abstraction. It describes how data are stored. ]
p => [  Logical level:  It is the next higher level of abstraction. It describes what data are stored in the database and what the relationship among those data is. ]
p => [  View level:  It is the highest level of data abstraction. It describes only part of the entire database. ]
h3 => [ 61) What is Hashing technique in the data structure? ]
p => [ Hashing is a faster searching technique. The process of mapping a large amount of data item to a smaller table with the help of a hashing function is called hashing. In other words, hashing is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array.  ]
p => [  In terms of java:  Hashing is a way to assign a unique code for any variable or object after applying any function or algorithm on its properties. ]
