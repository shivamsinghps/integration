h1 => [ MySQL Interview Questions ]
p => [ A list of top frequently asked MySQL interview questions and answers are given below. ]
h3 => [ 1) What is MySQL? ]
p => [ MySQL is a multithreaded, multi-user SQL database management system which has more than 11 million installations. It is the world's second most popular and widely-used open source database. It is interesting how MySQL name was given to this query language. The term My is coined by the name of the daughter of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and SQL is the short form of Structured Query Language. Using MySQL is free of cost for the developer, but enterprises have to pay a license fee to Oracle. ]
p => [ Formerly MySQL was initially owned by a for-profit firm MySQL AB, then Sun Microsystems bought it, and then Oracle bought Sun Microsystems, so Oracle currently owns MySQL. ]
p => [  MySQL  is an Oracle-supported Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) based on structured query language. MySQL supports a wide range of operating systems, most famous of those include Windows, Linux &amp; UNIX. Although it is possible to develop a wide range of applications with MySQL, it is only used for web applications &amp; online publishing. It is a fundamental part of an open-source enterprise known as Lamp. ]
strong => [ What is the Lamp? ]
p => [  The Lamp is a platform used for web development. The Lamp uses  Linux , Apache, MySQL, and  PHP  as an  operating system , web server, database &amp; object-oriented scripting language. And hence abbreviated as LAMP. ]
h3 => [ 2) In which language MySQL has been written? ]
p => [  MySQL is written in  C  and  C++ , and its  SQL  parser is written in yacc. ]
h3 => [ 3) What are the technical specifications of MySQL? ]

p => [ There is a major difference between a database and a table. The differences are as follows: ]
li => [ Tables are a way to represent the division of data in a database while the database is a collection of tables and data. ]
li => [ Tables are used to group the data in relation to each other and create a dataset. This dataset will be used in the database. The data stored in the table in any form is a part of the database, but the reverse is not true. ]
li => [ A database is a collection of organized data and features used to access them, whereas the table is a collection of rows and columns used to store the data. ]
h3 => [ 6) Why do we use the MySQL database server? ]
p => [ First of all, the MYSQL server is free to use for developers and small enterprises. ]
p => [ MySQL server is open source. ]
p => [ MySQL's community is tremendous and supportive; hence any help regarding MySQL is resolved as soon as possible. ]
p => [ MySQL has very stable versions available, as MySQL has been in the market for a long time. All bugs arising in the previous builds have been continuously removed, and a very stable version is provided after every update. ]
p => [ The MySQL database server is very fast, reliable, and easy to use. You can easily use and modify the software. MySQL software can be downloaded free of cost from the internet. ]
h3 => [ 7) What are the different tables present in MySQL? ]

li => [ MyISAM ]
li => [ Heap ]
li => [ Merge ]
li => [ INNO DB ]
li => [ ISAM ]
h3 => [ 8) How to install MySQL? ]
p => [ Installing MySQL on our system allows us to safely create, drop, and test web applications without affecting our live website's data. There are many ways to use MySQL on our system, but the best way is to install it manually. The manual installation allows us to learn more about the system and provides more control over the database. To see the installation steps of MySQL in Windows goes to the below link: ]

h3 => [ 12) How to add foreign keys in MySQL? ]
p => [ The foreign key is used to link one or more tables together. It matches the primary key field of another table to link the two tables. It allows us to create a parent-child relationship with the tables. We can add a foreign key to a table in two ways: ]
li => [ Using the CREATE TABLE Statement ]

Next, MySQL provides the mysqldump shell command to create a dumped copy of the selected database and then import all the data into the newly created database. The following is the syntax of using mysqldump command: ]
p => [ Now, use the below command to import the data into the newly created database: ]
h3 => [ 19) How to import a database in MySQL? ]
p => [ Importing database in MySQL is a process of moving data from one place to another place. It is a very useful method for backing up essential data or transferring our data between different locations. For example, we have a contact book database, which is essential to keep it in a secure place. So we need to export it in a safe place, and whenever it lost from the original location, we can restore it using import options. ]

p => [ This approach is similar to the way we join two tables. The following query returns result from three tables: ]
strong => [ 2. Using Parent-Child Relationship ]
p => [ It is another approach to join more than two tables. In the above tables, we have to create a parent-child relationship. First, create column X as a primary key in one table and as a foreign key in another table. Therefore, stud_id is the primary key in the Student table and will be a foreign key in the Marks table. Next, school_id is the primary key in the Marks table and will be a foreign key in the Details table. The following query returns result from three tables: ]

p => [ Indexing is a process to find an unordered list into an ordered list. It helps in maximizing the query's efficiency while searching on tables in MySQL. The working of MySQL indexing is similar to the book index. ]
p => [ Suppose we have a book and want to get information about, say, searching. Without indexing, it is required to go through all pages one by one, until the specific topic was not found. On the other hand, an index contains a list of keywords to find the topic mentioned on pages. Then, we can flip to those pages directly without going through all pages. ]

h3 => [ 55) What does "i_am_a_dummy flag" do in MySQL? ]
p => [ The "i_am_a_dummy flag" enables the MySQL engine to refuse any UPDATE or DELETE statement to execute if the WHERE clause is not present. Hence it can save the programmer from deleting the entire table my mistake if he does not use WHERE clause. ]

h3 => [ 76) What is the usage of ENUMs in MySQL? ]
p => [ ENUMs are string objects. By defining ENUMs, we allow the end-user to give correct input as in case the user provides an input that is not part of the ENUM defined data, then the query won't execute, and an error message will be displayed which says "The wrong Query". For instance, suppose we want to take the gender of the user as an input, so we specify ENUM('male', 'female', 'other'), and hence whenever the user tries to input any string any other than these three it results in an error. ]
p => [ ENUMs are used to limit the possible values that go in the table: ]
strong => [ For example: ]
p => [ CREATE TABLE months (month ENUM 'January', 'February', 'March'); INSERT months VALUES ('April'). ]
h3 => [ 77) What are the advantages of MyISAM over InnoDB? ]
p => [ MyISAM follows a conservative approach to disk space management and stores each MyISAM table in a separate file, which can be further compressed if required. On the other hand, InnoDB stores the tables in the tablespace. Its further optimization is difficult. ]
h3 => [ 78) What are the differences between MySQL_fetch_array(), MySQL_fetch_object(), MySQL_fetch_row()? ]

strong => [ For example: ]
p => [ Using mysql_fetch_object field can be accessed as $result-&gt;name. ]
p => [ Using mysql_fetch_array field can be accessed as $result-&gt;[name]. ]
p => [ Using mysql_fetch_row($result) where $result is the result resource returned from a successful query executed using the mysql_query() function. ]
strong => [ Example: ]
h3 => [ 79) What is the difference between mysql_connect and mysql_pconnect? ]
p => [ Mysql_connect() is used to open a new connection to the database, while mysql_pconnect() is used to open a persistent connection to the database. It specifies that each time the page is loaded, mysql_pconnect() does not open the database. ]

h3 => [ 92) What are DDL, DML, and DCL? ]
p => [ Majorly SQL commands can be divided into three categories, i.e., DDL, DML &amp; DCL. Data Definition Language (DDL) deals with all the database schemas, and it defines how the data should reside in the database. Commands like CreateTABLE and ALTER TABLE are part of DDL. ]
p => [ Data Manipulative Language (DML) deals with operations and manipulations on the data. The commands in DML are Insert, Select, etc. ]
p => [ Data Control Languages (DCL) are related to the Grant and permissions. In short, the authorization to access any part of the database is defined by these. ]
