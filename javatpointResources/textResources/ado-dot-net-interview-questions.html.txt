h1 => [ ADO.NET Interview Questions ]
p => [ A list of top frequently asked ADO.NET interview questions and answers are given below. ]
h3 => [ 1) What is ADO.NET? ]
p => [ ADO.NET stands for ActiveX Data Objects. It is a major component of the .NET framework. It is designed to connect with different databases like SQL, MySQL, Oracle, and MS Access, etc.  ]
h3 => [ 2) What are the objects of ADO.NET? ]
p => [ The two essential objects of ADO.Net are: ]
li => [ DataReader ]
li => [ DataSet ]
h3 => [ 3) What does DataReader Object do? ]
p => [ The DataReader object of ADO.NET is used to provide the access of data from a specified data source. It contains classes to sequentially read data from a data source like Oracle, MS Access, SQL Server, etc.  ]
h3 => [ 4) Can we load multiple tables in a Dataset? ]
p => [ Yes, you can load multiple tables in a dataset.  ]
h3 => [ 5) What are the essential features of ADO.NET? ]
li => [ ADO.NET provides inbuilt classes to make a connection with databases like Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, MS Access, etc.  ]
li => [ ADO.NET provides inbuilt classes for data manipulation operations like Insert, Update, Delete and Select data.  ]
li => [ Provide a function to combine data from different data sources.  ]
li => [ Disconnect data architecture for better performance. ]
h3 => [ 6) What are the advantages of ADO.NET? ]
p => [ Following are the advantages of ADO.NET: ]
li => [ Programmability  ]
li => [ Maintainability ]
li => [ Interoperability ]
li => [ Performance ]
li => [ Scalability  ]
h3 => [ 7) What are the main differences between classic ADO and ADO.NET? ]
p => [ These are the main differences between ADO and ADO.NET: ]
th => [ ADO ]
th => [ ADO.NET ]
h3 => [ 8) What is LINQ? ]
p => [ LINQ is a native query language for the .NET framework. It is specially designed to support queries with .NET applications. It can be connected with SQL and MS Access.  ]
h3 => [ 9) Is it possible to edit data in Repeater control? ]
p => [ No. It is read-only and forward-only control, so it is not possible to edit data in a repeater control. ]
h3 => [ 10) Which ADO.NET object is very fast in getting data from the database? ]
p => [ SqlDataReader object.  ]
h3 => [ 11) What is connection pooling? ]
p => [ Connection pooling contains database collections so that the connection can be used or reused whenever there is a request to the database. This technique increases the performance of executing the database commands because there is no need to create a new connection.  ]
h3 => [ 12) What are the ADO.NET connection pooling parameters? ]
li => [ Connection Lifetime: default values is 0. ]
li => [ Connection Timeout: default values is 15. ]
li => [ Max Pool Size: default values is 100. ]
li => [ Min Pool Size: default values is 0. ]
li => [ Pooling: default values are true. ]
li => [ Incr Pool Size: default values is 5. ]
li => [ Decr Pool Size: default values is 1. ]
h3 => [ 13) Do you use stored procedure in ADO.NET? ]
p => [ Yes, You can use a stored procedure in ADO.NET. It makes the performance fast because stored procedures are precompiled.  ]
h3 => [ 14) What is the use of Dataview? ]
p => [ Dataview is used to represent a whole table or a part of the table. It is used for sorting and searching data in the data table. ]
h3 => [ 15) What are the data providers used in ADO.NET ]
p => [ Following are the data providers used in ADO.NET: ]
li => [ MS SQL Server ]
li => [ OLEDB ]
li => [ ODBC ]
h3 => [ 16) What is the difference between Data Reader and Data Adapter? ]
th => [ Data Reader  ]
th => [ Data Adopter ]
td => [ The Data reader is read-only, forward only. It is much faster than data adopter. ]
td => [ It is comparatively slower.  ]
td => [ Data reader facilitates you to open and close connection explicitly.  ]
td => [ If you use data adopter, the connection is automatically open and closed. ]
td => [ Data reader makes a connection to the database to operate on data. ]
td => [ Data adopter is disconnected. ]
h3 => [ 17) What is the usage of the DataSet object in ADO.NET? ]
p => [ DataSet object is one of the major components of ADO.NET. It always remains disconnected from the database and reduces the load on the database. ]
h3 => [ 18) What are the different ADO.NET Namespaces? ]

li => [ Less Network Traffic ]
h3 => [ 21) What is the difference between Data Grid and Data Repeater? ]
strong => [ Data Grid: ]
li => [ Data grid has advanced features and facilitates you to do many things like paging and to sort your data without much effort. ]
li => [ Data grid can hold text data, but not linked or embedded objects. ]
strong => [ Data Repeater: ]
