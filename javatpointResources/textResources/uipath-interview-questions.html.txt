h3 => [ 16) What are the arguments? ]
p => [ The arguments in UiPath are mainly used when there is a requirement to pass data from one workflow to another. They are responsible for moving data between projects. These arguments follow a specific direction. For example- In, Out, In/Out. ]
h3 => [ 17) Define session variables. ]
p => [ In UiPath, session variables are defined as particular to the one instance of any process. If multiple instances of the corresponding process continue simultaneously, they all will have the same session variables. However, the values for those session variables will be different. ]
h3 => [ 18) Explain the generic variable. ]
p => [ In UiPath, the generic variable is the kind of variable that can hold any variety of data types. For example - arrays, int, strings, and date formats, etc. ]
h3 => [ 19) What is the role of properties in UiPath? ]
p => [ UiPath has a variety of activities that help us to automate desktop and web-based applications. Properties define such activities that are used for automating applications in the activity panel under UI automation. The basic properties of any project include ContinueOnError, Delay Before, Delay After, TimeoutMS, Target, and WaitForReady: ]
p => [  ContinueOnError : It is used when we want our automation continuously working even when the activity shows any error. Here, the 'False' is the default value. When an activity inside the 'try catch' is set to 'True', no error will be shown for the particular project. ]
p => [  Delay Before : It is used to pause the automation before any specific activity. ]
p => [  Delay After : It is used to pause the automation after any specific activity. ]
p => [  TimeoutMS : It is used to find the element before an error is displayed. ]
p => [  Target : It is used to identify the element before an activity begins. ]
p => [  WaitForReady : It is used to wait for the automation until the target is ready and before an activity is performed. ]
h3 => [ 20) Explain Flow Switch in the context of UiPath. ]
p => [ In the context of UiPath, flow decisions and flow switches are the same. The one significant difference between them is that the flow switch has an extra option called 'flow step'. Each branch of the flow switch is defined as a flow step and is not just restricted by true or false branch.  ]
h3 => [ 21) What does Branching mean? ]
p => [ Branching in UiPath is generally defined as the 'condition'. The branching condition is used when there is an activity with multiple solutions after any specific condition. This branching allows the program to decide what behavior should be displayed in case of the selection of any particular condition. ]
h3 => [ 22) What is the function of sequence activity in UiPath? ]
p => [ The sequence activity is a small project type responsible for allowing certain permissions to the path to move from one activity to another easily. In UiPath, the sequence activity is a single block activity, and these blocks are developed in such a way that they can be reused several times. ]
h3 => [ 23) Explain exception handling and its main options. ]
p => [ Exception Handling is the process of dealing or handling errors found in different activities in UiPath. ]
p => [ The exception handling mainly has the following options: ]
strong => [ Rethrow ]

strong => [ Throw ]
strong => [ Try Catch ]
h3 => [ 24) What are the types of recording options present in the UiPath tool? ]
p => [ UiPath provides the following recording options: ]
p => [  Basic : Because it generates a full selector for each activity, the basic recording is mainly used for single activities. ]
p => [  Desktop : Because it generates container activities and partial selectors for each included activity, the desktop recording is mainly used for all types of desktop applications. ]
p => [  Web : This option is mostly used for recording in web apps and browsers. This is because it generates container activities and uses the Simulate Type/Click input method by default. ]
p => [  Image : This recording option is best suitable for virtualized environments such as Citrix, SAP, VNC, and VMs. However, it is limited to only text, keyboard, and image automation. ]
p => [  Native Citrix : It is designed for desktop and applications that are virtualized through Citrix technology. ]
p => [  Computer Vision : It is suitable for automating designing workflows that use computer vision activities. ]
h3 => [ 25) What is the role of debugging? ]
p => [ In UiPath, debugging is the process of analyzing the entire project and then finding and removing errors. It highlights the activities and functionalities of the project and enables us to check all the project details. It displays information in the output panel and makes it easier for us to remove errors. While debugging a project, UiPath displays breakpoints throughout the project that can be used to pause the execution at any specific point. The debugging makes the process of identifying and removing errors easier.  ]
h3 => [ 26) Explain the variables and data types. ]
p => [ In UiPath, variables are commonly used to store data. The data stored in variables can be easily changed or updated. Variables allow us to store data in various forms. UiPath has different data types, such as number, text, date, time, data tables, and universal value, etc. ]
h3 => [ 27) Why do we use flowchart activities in UiPath? ]
p => [ The flowchart activities enable us to manage basic settings for any task in UiPath. We can use these activities for almost every type of automation project despite their length and complexity. Besides, flowcharts are used for segregating and building logical operations during the automation of complex business projects. Flowchart activities can be used to integrate necessary actions or functions in flowcharts during the automation process.  ]
h3 => [ 28) Why the term 'assign activity' is used in UiPath? ]
p => [ Assign activity in UiPath is mainly used for assigning the values to variables. This activity is mostly used when we want to change the value of the variable. Also, this activity helps in such cases when we want to implement a loop to our project. For example, incrementing the value of a variable in the loop. The activity remains in-built with the Favorites group by default. However, we can simply remove it by using 'Right-click' and then 'Remove' option. ]
p => [ There are two options that we can use by assign activity: ]
li => [ After adding the value, we can store values in the existing variable. ]
li => [ After adding the value, we can store values in any other array. ]
h3 => [ 29) Explain switch activity. ]
p => [ The switch activity in UiPath is used to switch from one value to another based on the defined values in the expression. It uses switch integer argument as default. However, we can easily change it by going to the properties panel and selecting the required Type of Argument (TypeArgument). The activity is mainly helpful during the categorization of data based on the case number. For example, we can use this activity to save data into different spreadsheets or to sort through a list of user names. ]
h3 => [ 30) What are the steps to handle the credentials in UiPath? ]
p => [ To handle credentials in UiPath, we need to follow the steps as listed below: ]
li => [ Using a credential manager on the corresponding window. ]
li => [ Storing the details in Orchestrator as the credential variable type. ]
li => [ Using a built-in input boxing feature to get secure text activity. ]
h3 => [ 31) What is meant by the Package manager in UiPath? ]
p => [ A package manager in UiPath is defined as the set of different elements that are helpful during the automation process. A package manager acts as the bundle that contains basic things of UiPath, such as frameworks, libraries, wrappers, etc. ]
h3 => [ 32) Why do we use break activity? ]
p => [ UiPath provides an option to stop any specific loop at any chosen point using the 'break' activity. We can use that time to proceed with any other single activity or multiple activities as per the project's need.  ]
h3 => [ 33) Why do we use 'do while' activity? ]
p => [ The 'do while' activity is a condition used to execute any particular part of the automation project when the condition is true. If the specified condition doesn't meet, means the condition is false, the project exits the loop. It can be used to step through array elements in the automation project in UiPath. The activity is also useful to execute any specific activity multiple times. We can easily increment counters if we want to browse through array indices or when we want to step through a list of items. ]
h3 => [ 34) Why do we use the If activity? ]
p => [ The 'If' activity is a combination of a statement and two different conditions. This activity is mainly used to compare two values or two activities based on specified conditions. In this process, if the condition satisfies, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false. The first condition is executed only when the particular statement is true, while the second (the statement inside the else block) is executed when the statement is false. The 'If' activity is beneficial in cases where we want to make decisions based on the values of the variables. ]
h3 => [ 35) What is the use of For Each activity? ]
p => [ For Each activity in UiPath is used to step through arrays, lists, data tables, or other types of collections. It enables us to iterate through the data and then individually process each piece of the information. ]
h3 => [ 36) What are the supported OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engines in UiPath? ]
p => [ The following are the supported OCR engines in UiPath: ]
li => [ Google ]
li => [ Microsoft ]
li => [ Abby ]
h3 => [ 37) Is there any option for automatic recording in UiPath? ]
p => [ Yes, UiPath allows us to record the actions and activities performed on the system automatically. The automatic recording feature provides a variety of options that we can use to customize the project easily. It generates a skeleton of the entire performed process. Because we can easily parameterize and customize the process, it saves a lot of time instead of manually automating the entire project.  ]
h3 => [ 38) What is meant by the term 'Packaging' in UiPath? ]
p => [ In UiPath, the term packaging is used to archive and send automation packages to software robots so that these packages can be executed. While working on UiPath, the projects are generally displayed on the packages page in the orchestrator field. We can distribute these packages to the connected robots by assigning them to specific robots in the environment. If we are not connected to the orchestrator, the packages will get stored locally in the UiPath Studio feed by default. ]
h3 => [ 39) Explain Control Flow in the context of UiPath. ]
p => [ The concept of Control Flow is derived from computer science, which is used to define the order or the sequence of actions executed in automation. To achieve a well-formatted Control Flow, we are required to use appropriate variables and activities during the automation process. ]
h3 => [ 40) What is the use of Delay activity? ]
p => [ We can use the delay activity to pause or stop the automation for any specific period. The delay activity is mainly used when we require some time for any specific application or activity to be processed. At that particular delay period, we can process some other activities of the automation process.  ]
