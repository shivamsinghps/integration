p => [ For house construction purpose, the following five types of cement are mainly used: ]
p => [  Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) 43 Grade Cement:  This cement is mainly used for wall plastering works, Non-RCC structures, pathways etc. It gets a compression strength of 43 Mpa (megapascals) in 28 days of setting. ]
p => [  Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), 53 Grade Cement:  This cement is mainly used in RCC and pre-stressed concrete of higher grades, cement grouts, instant plugging mortars etc. This cement is best for fast-paced construction, where the initial strength is to be achieved quickly. It gets a compression strength of 53 Mpa (megapascals) in 28 days of setting. It attains 27 Mpa in 7days compared to 23 Mpa by 43-grade cement. ]
p => [  Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC):  This cement has a higher degree of fineness, impermeable and corrosion-resistant quality that makes the concrete denser in large structures. The initial setting time of this cement is low, but it gains more strength with time. It is used in mass concreting work as well as RCC work. ]
p => [  Portland Slag Cement (PSC):  This type of cement is preferred over OPC grade in constructions where the structures are more liable to sulfate and chloride attack. This has an excellent corrosion resistance quality, particularly from saltwater so, it is widely used in coastal regions, sewage disposal, and water treatment plants. ]

h3 => [ 10) What is the blended cement, and what are the advantages of using blended cement?  ]
p => [ Blended cement is obtained by mixing OPC (Ordinary Portland cement) with mineral admixtures or additives like fly ash, slag or silica fumes. These mineral admixtures make the blended cement superior as compared to the conventional OPC category of cement. ]
strong => [ The advantages of using blended cement can be categorized into two types: ]
li => [ Technical advantages ]
li => [ Environmental advantages ]
strong => [ Technical Advantages of using Blended Cement ]
li => [ Blended cement is smoother than Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). It provides a finer texture than OPC when mixed. ]
li => [ It provides more strength than OPC because fly ash and slag cement are significantly stronger than OPC after full setting (more than 28 days) in compressive and flexural stress. It depends on the proportion and quality of the admixture. Silica fume cement sets in even less time, usually 3 to 28 days. ]
li => [ The permeability is lower in blended cement. It extends its useful life and hardness by reducing the penetration of aggressive water run-off compounds such as sulfates and chlorides, which have increased impact as ordinary cement ages. Silica fume cement allows only 20 percent of the permeability of OPC. ]
li => [ When we use OPC, if the temperature differences between the concrete surface and its interior are high, it may get weaker, and cracking can occur. So, OPC is not a good choice for the areas where temperatures fall below 40 degrees. Blended cement can reduce peak temperatures and reduce the risk of thermal stress. ]
strong => [ Environmental Advantages of using Blended Cement ]
li => [ Blended cement requires less water in construction. ]
li => [ Blended cement saves energy because it uses admixtures such as slag, fly ash, which is produced as a byproduct of other industrial processes. ]
li => [ Blended cement is a good example of the conservation of resources. It uses waste products of steel plants and coal power plants, among others. Using this waste in cement lowers the demand for other components like limestone, silica, and clay, helping to preserve these natural resources. ]
h3 => [ 11) What is the requirement of curves on the road? What are the different types of curves? ]

h3 => [ 12) What is concrete?  ]
p => [ Concrete is a mixture of cement, sand, stone aggregates (jelly) and water. The proportions of the ingredients are mixed according to the type of construction.  ]
h3 => [ 13) What is compacting, and why is it used?  ]
p => [ Compacting is the process of making the cement mixture denser by releasing the air from it. When we mix various materials, there will be air which is entrapped between them. We have to remove these air bubbles to make concrete impervious and attain maximum strength. Otherwise, there will be voids in the concrete, which reduce the strength substantially.  ]
h3 => [ 14) What is the best way of compacting?  ]

h3 => [ 69) What is the difference between absorption, adsorption, and sorption?  ]
p => [ Absorption is when an atom, molecule or ions enter any bulk phase like gas, solid or liquid. In this process, the energy of a photon is transferred to another entity. On the other hand, adsorption occurs when the gas or liquid solute accumulates on the solid's surface. So, adsorption is also similar to absorption, but it refers to the surface rather than a volume. ]
p => [ The main difference between absorption and adsorption is that one is a bulk process, and the other is a surface process. Sorption describes the actions of absorption and adsorption both. ]
h3 => [ 70) What is the role of compacting in concrete? ]
p => [ The role of compacting in concrete is very important. When we mix various materials with cement, some air bubbles are entrapped between them. We have to remove these air bubbles to make concrete impervious and attain maximum strength. Otherwise, these air bubbles would form voids in the concrete, which reduce the strength substantially. That is why compacting important.  ]
h3 => [ 71) What is the best way of compacting?  ]
p => [ There are several ways which we can do for compacting. For example, we can use steel rods or paddling sticks, but mechanical vibrators are best for compacting. A compacting device is considered the best device which reaches the bottom of the form and should be small enough to pass between reinforcement rods.  ]
h3 => [ 72) What is curing, and how is it done?  ]
p => [ Curing is a process of maintaining a favorable environment for moisture retention in concrete or supplying of water shower to the concrete from an external source. We have to sprinkle water from the top to curing the newly constructed walls and kept them wet. It is good for the slab or roof to make ponds of 1m x 1m and gently pour sufficient water. Beams and columns should be kept wet by covering a wet sack over them.  ]
h3 => [ 73) How many days should the curing is done normally?  ]
