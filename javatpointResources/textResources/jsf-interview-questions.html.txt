p => [ A list of top frequently asked JSF interview questions and answers are given below.
 ]
h3 => [ 1) What is JSF (JavaServer Faces)? ]
p => [ It is a server-side component-based user interface framework. It is used to develop web applications. It provides a well-defined programming model and consists of rich API and tag libraries. The latest version JSF 2 uses Facelets as its default templating system. ]

h3 => [ 2) What are the benefits of JSF (JavaServer Faces)? ]
p => [ It provides a clean and clear separation between behavior and presentation of the web application. You can write business logic and user interface separately. ]

 ]
h3 => [ 4) Give the system requirements for the JSF use. ]
p => [ For using JSF in a computer, the platform needs to have JDK 1.5 or above. ]
h3 => [ 5) What is the life cycle of JSF (JavaServer Faces)? ]
p => [ JavaServer Faces application framework manages lifecycle phases automatically for simple applications and also allows you to manage that manually. The lifecycle of a JavaServer Faces application begins when the client makes an HTTP request for a page and ends when the server responds with the page. ]
p => [  For more information:   Click here. 
 ]
h3 => [ 6) How does the execution phase work in JSF (JavaServer Faces) life cycle? ]
p => [ In the execute phase, when the first request is made, the application view is built or restored. For other subsequent requests other actions are performed like request parameter values are applied, conversions and validations are performed for component values, managed beans are updated with component values, and application logic is invoked. ]
p => [  For more information:   Click here. 
 ]
h3 => [ 7) How does render phase work in JSF (JavaServer Faces) life cycle? ]
p => [ In this phase, the requested view is rendered as a response to the client browser. View rendering is a process in which output is generated as HTML or XHTML. So, the user can see it on the browser. ]
