p => [ In ServiceNow, an application represents a packaged solution for delivering services and managing business processes. In other words, we can say that an application is a collection of modules that gives information about those modules. For example, the Incident application provides information related to the Incident Management process.  ]
h3 => [ 4) What is the full form of CMDB, and what is its usage? ]

h3 => [ 8) What do you understand by the term "Business Rule."?  ]
p => [ The business rule is a server-side script. It runs whenever any record is inserted, modified, deleted, displayed or when a table is queried. The main point to keep for creating a business rule is when and what action it is supposed to execute. You can apply the business rule 'on display,' 'on before' or 'on after' when action is performed.  ]

h3 => [ 11) What do you understand by Dictionary Override? ]
p => [ A dictionary override is used to define an extended table or field differently from its parent table's field. You can see the following example to understand it better: ]
p => [ For example, we can use a dictionary override for a task table field to change the default value on the incident table without changing the default value on the change or task table field. This is the main benefit of dictionary overrides. ]
h3 => [ 12) What do you understand by domain separation in ServiceNow? ]
p => [ Domain separation is a useful method of ServiceNow. It is used to separate data into logically defined domains. It also provides an option to separate administration. ]
p => [ For example, suppose Alex is the CEO of two companies, and he is using ServiceNow single instance for both of these businesses. He doesn't want the user of one business can see the data of another business. So, he can use domain separation to isolate the records from both businesses. ]

h3 => [ 14) What do you understand by the term coalesce?  ]
p => [ Coalesce is set in the Transform Map. It is a property of a field used in transform map field mapping. It is just a true or false value between a source Import Set field and a target table field. Coalescing on a field or set of fields facilitates us to use the field as a unique key. If it finds a match using the coalesce field, ServiceNow will update the existing record with imported information. If a match is not found, then it inserts a new record into the database.  ]
h3 => [ 15) What is a data policy in ServiceNow? ]
p => [ In ServiceNow, data policies are almost similar to UI policies. Data Policies facilitate a developer to enforce online data policies by assigning read-only attributes for all the fields. ]
strong => [ Following is a list of some main differences between data policy and UI policy: ]
li => [ UI policy only applies to data entered on a form by using a standard browser. On the other hand, data policies can apply rules for every data entered into the system. ]
li => [ Unlike the UI Policies, Data Policies execute server-side. ]
li => [ UI Policy logic only applies to data entered in a form, and the developers cannot apply scripts to Data Policies. ]
h3 => [ 16) What are the UI policies in ServiceNow?  ]
p => [ UI policies are used to set mandatory fields, which are read-only and visible on a form. These are used for dynamically changing a field on a form and control custom process flows for tasks. UI policies are alternatives to client scripts.  ]

h3 => [ 25) What is impersonating a user? How is it beneficial? ]
p => [ Impersonating a user makes an administrator able to sign in to the system as a different user. This process is used to provide the administrator access to the modules and menus that the user had access to. ServiceNow records the administrator's activities when they are impersonating another user. ]
p => [ Impersonating a user is quite beneficial as it enables testing. We can use this feature for testing the solution without logging out from our session. If you don't use impersonating a user feature, you would have to log out from your session and log in again with that user's credentials for testing. ]

p => [ The inactivity monitor triggers an event for a task record if it has remained inactive for a certain amount of time. If the task continues to remain idle, the inactivity monitor repeats at regular intervals. ]
h3 => [ 30) What do you understand by the data dictionary? ]
p => [ The data dictionary contains information about a field's data type, default value, dependency, and other attributes. It is also used to define every table and field in the system.  ]
h3 => [ 31) What would happen if a user makes some changes to the homepage?  ]
p => [ If a user makes some changes on the homepage, then that page is saved as his/her personalized homepage instead of updating on the actual homepage. For example, suppose you have a home page name, "Records." When a user makes some changes to it, this page is saved as "My Records" and is only visible to that user.  ]
h3 => [ 32) What is the usage of the Client Transaction Timings plug-in? ]
