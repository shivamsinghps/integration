strong => [ A list of key differences between Java and JavaScript ]
th => [ Java ]
th => [ JavaScript ]
td => [ Java is a complete and strongly typed programming language used for backend coding. In Java, variables must be declared first to use in the program, and the type of a variable is checked at compile-time. ]
td => [ JavaScript is a weakly typed, lightweight programming language (most commonly known as scripting language) and has more relaxed syntax and rules. ]
td => [ Java is an object-oriented programming (OOPS) language or structured programming languages such as C, C++, or .Net. ]

strong => [ Primitive data types ]
p => [ The primitive data types are as follows: ]
p => [  String:  The string data type represents a sequence of characters. It is written within quotes and can be represented using a single or a double quote. ]
strong => [ Example: ]
p => [  Number:  The number data type is used to represent numeric values and can be written with or without decimals. ]
strong => [ Example: ]
p => [  Boolean:  The Boolean data type is used to represent a Boolean value, either false or true. This data type is generally used for conditional testing. ]
strong => [ Example: ]
p => [  BigInt:  The BigInt data type is used to store numbers beyond the Number data type limitation. This data type can store large integers and is represented by adding "n" to an integer literal. ]
strong => [ Example: ]
p => [  Undefined:  The Undefined data type is used when a variable is declared but not assigned. The value of this data type is undefined, and its type is also undefined. ]
strong => [ Example: ]
p => [  Null:  The Null data type is used to represent a non-existent, null, or a invalid value i.e. no value at all. ]
strong => [ Example: ]
p => [  Symbol:  Symbol is a new data type introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript. It is used to store an anonymous and unique value. ]
strong => [ Example: ]
p => [  typeof:  The typeof operator is used to determine what type of data a variable or operand contains. It can be used with or without parentheses (typeof(x) or typeof x). This is mainly used in situations when you need to process the values of different types. ]
strong => [ Example: ]
strong => [ Non-Primitive data types ]
p => [ In the above examples, we can see that the primitive data types can store only a single value. To store multiple and complex values, we have to use non-primitive data types. ]
p => [ The non-primitive data types are as follows: ]
p => [  Object:  The Object is a non-primitive data type. It is used to store collections of data. An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, such as strings, numbers, Booleans, or complex data types like arrays, functions, and other objects. ]
strong => [ Example: ]
p => [  Array:  The Array data type is used to represent a group of similar values. Every value in an array has a numeric position, called its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, Booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays. The array index starts from 0 so that the first array element is arr[0], not arr[1]. ]
strong => [ Example: ]
a => [ More details. ]
h3 => [ 25) What is the difference between == and ===? ]
p => [ The == operator checks equality only whereas === checks equality, and data type, i.e., a value must be of the same type. ]

h3 => [ 31) What is the output of 10+20+"30" in JavaScript? ]
p => [ 3030 because 10+20 will be 30. If there is numeric value before and after +, it treats as binary + (arithmetic operator).  ]
h3 => [ 32) What is the output of "10"+20+30 in JavaScript? ]
p => [ 102030 because after a string all the + will be treated as string concatenation operator (not binary +). ]
h3 => [ 33) Difference between Client side JavaScript and Server side JavaScript? ]
p => [  Client-side JavaScript  comprises the basic language and predefined objects which are relevant to running JavaScript in a browser. The client-side JavaScript is embedded directly by in the HTML pages. The browser interprets this script at runtime. ]
p => [  Server-side JavaScript  also resembles client-side JavaScript. It has a relevant JavaScript which is to run in a server. The server-side JavaScript are deployed only after compilation. ]
h3 => [ 34) In which location cookies are stored on the hard disk? ]
p => [ The storage of cookies on the hard disk depends on the OS and the browser. ]
p => [ The Netscape Navigator on Windows uses a cookies.txt file that contains all the cookies. The path is c:\Program Files\Netscape\Users\username\cookies.txt ]
p => [  The Internet Explorer stores the cookies on a file  [email&nbsp;protected]  The path is: c:\Windows\Cookies\ [email&nbsp;protected] ]
h3 => [ 35) What's the difference between event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation() methods in JavaScript?  ]
p => [ In JavaScript, the event.preventDefault() method is used to prevent the default behavior of an element. ]
p => [  For example:  If you use it in a form element, it prevents it from submitting. If used in an anchor element, it prevents it from navigating. If used in a contextmenu, it prevents it from showing or displaying. ]
p => [ On the other hand, the event.stopPropagation() method is used to stop the propagation of an event or stop the event from occurring in the bubbling or capturing phase. ]
h3 => [ 36) What is the real name of JavaScript? ]
p => [  The original name was  Mocha , a name chosen by Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape. In September of 1995, the name was changed to LiveScript. In December 1995, after receiving a trademark license from Sun, the name JavaScript was adopted.  ]
h3 => [ 37) How can you check if the event.preventDefault() method was used in an element?  ]
p => [ When we use the event.defaultPrevent() method in the event object returns a Boolean indicating that the event.preventDefault() was called in a particular element.  ]
h3 => [ 38) What is the difference between undefined value and null value? ]
p => [  Undefined value:  A value that is not defined and has no keyword is known as undefined value. For example: ]
p => [  Null value:  A value that is explicitly specified by the keyword "null" is known as a null value. For example: ]

h3 => [ 52) What is this keyword in JavaScript? ]
p => [ The this keyword is a reference variable that refers to the current object. For example: ]
h3 => [ 53) What is the requirement of debugging in JavaScript? ]
p => [ JavaScript didn't show any error message in a browser. However, these mistakes can affect the output. The best practice to find out the error is to debug the code. The code can be debugged easily by using web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firebox. ]
p => [ To perform debugging, we can use any of the following approaches:  ]
li => [ Using console.log() method ]
li => [ Using debugger keyword ]
h3 => [ 54) What is the use of debugger keyword in JavaScript? ]
p => [ JavaScript debugger keyword sets the breakpoint through the code itself. The debugger stops the execution of the program at the position it is applied. Now, we can start the flow of execution manually. If an exception occurs, the execution will stop again on that particular line.. For example: ]
h3 => [ 55) What is the role of a strict mode in JavaScript? ]
p => [ The JavaScript strict mode is used to generates silent errors. It provides "use strict"; expression to enable the strict mode. This expression can only be placed as the first statement in a script or a function. For example:  ]
h3 => [ 57) What is the use of Math object in JavaScript? ]
p => [ The JavaScript math object provides several constants and methods to perform a mathematical operation. Unlike date object, it doesn't have constructors. For example:  ]
h3 => [ 58) What is the use of a Date object in JavaScript? ]
p => [ The JavaScript date object can be used to get a year, month and day. You can display a timer on the webpage by the help of JavaScript date object. ]
h3 => [ 59) What is the use of a Number object in JavaScript? ]
p => [ The JavaScript number object enables you to represent a numeric value. It may be integer or floating-point. JavaScript number object follows the IEEE standard to represent the floating-point numbers. ]
h3 => [ 60) What is the use of a Boolean object in JavaScript? ]
p => [ The JavaScript Boolean is an object that represents value in two states: true or false. You can create the JavaScript Boolean object by Boolean() constructor. ]
h3 => [ 61) What is the use of a TypedArray object in JavaScript? ]
p => [ The JavaScript TypedArray object illustrates an array like a view of an underlying binary data buffer. There is any number of different global properties, whose values are TypedArray constructors for specific element types. ]
h3 => [ 62) What is the use of a Set object in JavaScript? ]
p => [ The JavaScript Set object is used to store the elements with unique values. The values can be of any type i.e. whether primitive values or object references. For example: ]
h3 => [ 63) What is the use of a WeakSet object in JavaScript? ]
p => [ The JavaScript WeakSet object is the type of collection that allows us to store weakly held objects. Unlike Set, the WeakSet are the collections of objects only. It doesn't contain the arbitrary values. For example: ]
h3 => [ 64) What is the use of a Map object in JavaScript? ]
p => [ The JavaScript Map object is used to map keys to values. It stores each element as key-value pair. It operates the elements such as search, update and delete on the basis of specified key. For example: ]
h3 => [ 65) What is the use of a WeakMap object in JavaScript? ]
p => [ The JavaScript WeakMap object is a type of collection which is almost similar to Map. It stores each element as a key-value pair where keys are weakly referenced. Here, the keys are objects and the values are arbitrary values. For example: ]
h3 => [ 66) What are the falsy values in JavaScript, and how can we check if a value is falsy? ]
p => [ Those values which become false while converting to Boolean are called falsy values.  ]
p => [ We can check if a value is falsy by using the Boolean function or the Double NOT operator (!!).  ]
h3 => [ 67) What do you understand by hoisting in JavaScript? ]
p => [ Hoisting is the default behavior of JavaScript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top. In simple words, we can say that Hoisting is a process in which, irrespective of where the variables and functions are declared, they are moved on top of the scope. The scope can be both local and global. ]
