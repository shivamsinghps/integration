He always had a smile on his face no matter how hard he worked or how bad his day was passed. He loved everyone. He has always thought me to not worry about my weakness and take most advantage of my strengths. This has developed a lot of confidence in me during difficult times.

p => [  Example 2:  "My greatest inspiration is Rahul Dravid.

h3 => [ 19) Are you ready /flexible to relocate in the future?  ]

p => [ Being a fresher, you should be flexible enough to suit the staffing need of the company. It is also easy for a company to move a fresher on short notice because they have less baggage (for example, single). This applies to a foreign country placement also. So, if you deny a relocation means, you are saying "No" to an onsite opportunity as well. ]
p => [  A good sample answer should be like this:   ]
p => [  Example 1:  "Yes, most definitely. I don't have any issue to relocate because being at different locations can help me to learn about new culture and people." ]
p => [  Example 2:  "Yes, I don't have any problem in relocation. It is always better to learn experience than being around with same environment and people." ]
h3 => [ 20) Are you flexible with timings? / Do you have any issues if you have to work in night shift? ]

This question is asked to check about your flexibility in the timing of your job hours. There are always some challenges in working in shifts. The employers are well aware of these challenges and look to hire people who can handle this unpredictability. ]
p => [ The same above answer applies here. Being a fresher, the company assumes that you have not any issue with the timings. If you have any genuine issue or problem to work in the night or early morning shifts, you can mention here. Remember that your negative answer might slightly reduce your chance of getting the job. Suppose the company has some foreign clients and needs you to work the night shift, then the company prefers the candidate who has no issue with timing. ]
strong => [ Examples of best sample answers: ]
p => [  Example 1:  Absolutely, sir. I don't have any issues with shift changes. I live alone, and I don't mind if the company allows me night or early morning shifts. ]
p => [  Example 2:  I am available to work any shift as you require. I must be there when the company needs me. ]

p => [  Example 4:  I will work whatever shift is required because I feel responsible for the company to complete the necessary work. ]
p => [  Example 5:  I am only available during regular business hours as there is an elderly family member who I need to care for during other times. But if the company needs me in the case of an urgent situation, then I will be available. ]
p => [  Example 6:  As a girl, I am not comfortable with night shifts due to safety concerns, but I am happy to work any other shift as needed. ]
p => [  Example 7:  I would be happy to work night and weekend shifts if the company provides me a cab facility and have a proper security guard in place. ]
h3 => [ 21) Do you want to pursue higher education?  ]
p => [ If you have an immediate plan for higher education seriously, it is good to say so. If you are unsure (maybe or may not be), you can answer like the following: ]
p => [  Example 1:  "I am interested in higher studies, but not immediately. I want to start my career and then look for higher studies after gaining some experience in this field. ]
p => [  Example 2:  "Yes, but not immediately. After getting some experience in my field, I will do an MBA or VLSI engineering masters, depending on which will be more beneficial for my line of work." ]
p => [ Some companies support and provide incentives to their employees for higher studies. If you know that your employer company has any such programs, you can align your answer accordingly. ]
h3 => [ 22) What are your expectations from your first job? ]
p => [ To answer this question, you can quote a simple vision or strategy about the company you like most. The most important expectation for a fresher is to "Learn," which most companies expect from you. You can also say that you want to place yourself within the corporate world, pay off your education loan, contribute to society, etc. ]
p => [  The best possible answers are:   ]
p => [  Example 1:  "I have had lot of studies during my college years, but mostly theoretical leanings. So, my first expectation from my first job would be to learn how all these are applied in a practical and industrial way. I also want to be a part of the corporate culture and be a good asset for the company." ]
p => [  Example 2:  " Sir, this is my first job and I consider this as an extension of my studies only. This is more like a practical class for me. Here, I want to learn new technologies, learn how the corporate world works, be the part of a big energetic team and contribute to the projects. I also want to develop my soft skills to make a good place in this tough and challenging corporate life in future." ]
h3 => [ 23) Do you have any questions for us? ]
p => [ This is probably the last interview question where the interviewer leaves scope for you to clear your doubts.

p => [ You should prepare at least 3 or 4 questions in mind to ask at the end of the interview. It creates a positive impact. ]
strong => [ Some Important Tips: ]
li => [ Ask intelligent questions that show your curiosity to know more about the company, its policies, people, any specific skill you need to acquire for the given role, etc. ]
li => [ Don't ask irrelevant questions such as the duration of lunch hours, how often the company organizes parties, or how soon you will be promoted to the next level. ]
