p => [ Check constraint is a database rule that checks data integrity. Thus, only values from the domain for the attribute or column are allowed. ]
h3 => [ 16) What is DB2 Bind? ]
p => [ DB2 bind is process that prepares an access path to the data. This access path is stored as a package in the DB2 catalogue.  ]
h3 => [ 17) What is DBRM? ]
p => [ DBRM stands for Database Request Module. It is a component inside DB2, which is created by the pre compiler of DB2. It contains SQL source statements that get extracted out of the application program. DBRMs form inputs that are helpful in the binding process. ]
h3 => [ 18) What is buffer Pool?  ]
p => [ Buffer pool is part of main memory space. This space is allotted by the database manager. It cache table and index data from the disk. ]
h3 => [ 19) What is data manager? ]
p => [ Data manager is a DB2 component that is responsible to manage physical database. It performs logging and locking by invoking other system components.  ]
h3 => [ 20) What do you mean by storage group (STOGROUP)? ]
p => [ Storage group is a storage path where data can be stored. A table space can also be assigned to storage group. ]
h3 => [ 21) What is the use of predicate? ]
p => [ Predicates are used to enhance the performance of query.  ]
h3 => [ 22) What is the physical storage length of TIME data type? ]
p => [ The physical storage length of TIME data type is 3 bytes. ]
h3 => [ 23) What is the physical storage length of DATE data type? ]
p => [ The physical storage length of TIME data type is 4 bytes.  ]
h3 => [ 24) What is the physical storage length of TIMESTAMP data type? ]
p => [ TIMESTAMP data type takes 10 bytes and default is YYYY-MM-DD: HH: MM:SS-NNNNNN  ]
h3 => [ 25) What is DCLGEN (Declaration Generator)? ]
p => [ The declaration generator provides an SQL Declare Table statement and language like COBOL, C data declaration for a particular table or view.  ]

li => [ BP0 ]
li => [ BP1 ]
li => [ BP2 ]
li => [ BP32 ]
h3 => [ 27) Which component is responsible for processing SQL statements and selecting access paths? ]
p => [ DB2 optimizer is used to select the access paths and for processing SQL statements. ]
h3 => [ 28) What is concurrency in DB2? ]
p => [ Concurrency is the process in which more than one application can access the similar data at same time. ]
h3 => [ 29) Which isolation level provides maximum concurrency? ]
p => [ Uncommitted read provides maximum concurrency. ]
h3 => [ 30) Which isolation level provides highest data integrity? ]
p => [ Repeatable Read provides highest data integrity as it holds page and lock the rows until a COMMIT point. ]
h3 => [ 31) What is RCT? ]
p => [ Resource Control Table (RCT) is controller that directs the CICS DB2 interface. Using DSNCRCT, RCT can produce a micro table.  ]

h3 => [ 40) What is the reason behind not using SELECT * in Embedded SQL programs? ]
p => [ There are three reasons for not using SELECT * in embedded SQL programs: ]
li => [ If you change the table structure i.e. adding a field, the program will have to be modified. ]
li => [ Program can retrieve the columns which it might not use, leading an I/O overhead. ]
li => [ The chance of an index only scan is lost. ]
h3 => [ 41) What is the usage of OPEN CURSOR command? ]
p => [ If you use the OPEN CURSOR command with ORDER BY clause, the rows are fetched, sorted and made available for the FETCH statement. Otherwise simply the cursor is placed on the first row. ]
h3 => [ 42) What is the COBOL picture clause of the DB2 data types DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP? ]

p => [ TIMESTAMP PIC X(26) ]
h3 => [ 43) What is DCLGEN? ]
p => [ DCLGEN is stands for DeCLarations GENErator. It is used to create the host language copy books for the table definitions. It also creates the DECLARE table. ]
h3 => [ 44) What are the contents of a DCLMGEN?  ]
li => [ EXEC SQL DECLARE TABLE statement which gives the layout of the table in terms of DB2 data type. ]
li => [ A host language copy book that gives the host variable definitions for the column name. ]
