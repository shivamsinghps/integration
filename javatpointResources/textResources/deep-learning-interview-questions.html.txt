li => [ The deep learning model is not good for small data sets, and it fails here. ]
h3 => [ 13) What is the meaning of term weight initialization in neural networks? ]
p => [ In neural networking, weight initialization is one of the essential factors. A bad weight initialization prevents a network from learning. On the other side, a good weight initialization helps in giving a quicker convergence and a better overall error. Biases can be initialized to zero. The standard rule for setting the weights is to be close to zero without being too small. ]
h3 => [ 14) Explain Data Normalization. ]
p => [ Data normalization is an essential preprocessing step, which is used to rescale values to fit in a specific range. It assures better convergence during backpropagation. In general, data normalization boils down to subtracting the mean of each data point and dividing by its standard deviation. ]
h3 => [ 15) Why is zero initialization not a good weight initialization process? ]
p => [ If the set of weights in the network is put to a zero, then all the neurons at each layer will start producing the same output and the same gradients during backpropagation. ]
p => [ As a result, the network cannot learn at all because there is no source of asymmetry between neurons. That is the reason why we need to add randomness to the weight initialization process. ]

h3 => [ 23) What is the sigmoid function? ]
p => [  The sigmoid activation function is also called the logistic function. It is traditionally a trendy activation function for neural networks. The input data to the function is transformed into a value between  0.0  and  1.0 . Input values that are much larger than 1.0 are transformed to the value 1.0. Similarly, values that are much smaller than 0.0 are transformed into 0.0. The shape of the function for all possible inputs is an S-shape from zero up through 0.5 to 1.0. It was the default activation used on neural networks, in the early 1990s. ]
h3 => [ 24) What is Tanh function? ]

Later in the 1990s and through the 2000s, this function was preferred over the sigmoid activation function as models. It was easier to train and often had better predictive performance. ]
h3 => [ 25) What is ReLU function? ]
p => [  A node or unit which implements the activation function is referred to as a  rectified linear activation unit  or ReLU for short. Generally, networks that use the rectifier function for the hidden layers are referred to as  rectified networks . ]
p => [ Adoption of ReLU may easily be considered one of the few milestones in the deep learning revolution. ]
h3 => [ 26) What is the use of leaky ReLU function? ]
p => [ The Leaky ReLU (LReLU or LReL) manages the function to allow small negative values when the input is less than zero. ]
h3 => [ 27) What is the softmax function? ]
p => [ The softmax function is used to calculate the probability distribution of the event over 'n' different events. One of the main advantages of using softmax is the output probabilities range. The range will be between 0 to 1, and the sum of all the probabilities will be equal to one. When the softmax function is used for multi-classification model, it returns the probabilities of each class, and the target class will have a high probability. ]

h3 => [ 31) In which layer softmax activation function used? ]
p => [ Softmax activation function has to be used in the output layer. ]
h3 => [ 32) What do you understand by Autoencoder? ]
p => [ Autoencoder is an artificial neural network. It can learn representation for a set of data without any supervision. The network automatically learns by copying its input to the output; typically,internet representation consists of smaller dimensions than the input vector. As a result, they can learn efficient ways of representing the data. Autoencoder consists of two parts; an encoder tries to fit the inputs to the internal representation, and a decoder converts the internal state to the outputs. ]
h3 => [ 33) What do you mean by Dropout? ]
p => [ Dropout is a cheap regulation technique used for reducing overfitting in neural networks. We randomly drop out a set of nodes at each training step. As a result, we create a different model for each training case, and all of these models share weights. It's a form of model averaging. ]
h3 => [ 34) What do you understand by Tensors? ]
p => [ Tensors are nothing but a de facto for representing the data in deep learning. They are just multidimensional arrays, which allows us to represent the data having higher dimensions. In general, we deal with high dimensional data sets where dimensions refer to different features present in the data set. ]

It may depend on variables such as weights and biases.It provides the performance of a neural network as a whole. In deep learning, our priority is to minimize the cost function.
