Here, one point should be noted that both NDA and CDS exams are conducted to recruit officers in IAF for FLYING BRANCH ONLY, meaning only as pilots.

p => [ The interviewing officer asks you this question because he wants to know your awareness about the profession, foresightedness, clarity of vision, self-motivation, desire to accomplish as a leader, and your vision for future personal growth. Here, you have to give a positive answer that showcases all your positive aspects for your choice, without any hesitation. ]
strong => [ A Sample Answer: ]
p => [ Sir, the first reason is that I am more inclined towards joining the forces in the technical field and contribute as a Mechanical Engineer. Secondly, I am already working as a service engineer in a reputed MNC, so; I have some time issues and get less time to study. That's why I have decided to opt for available options rather than AFCAT. ]
h3 => [ 8) Why didn't you try for SSB after 12th through NDA? ]
p => [ The interviewing officer asks this question to see your passion and core interest for the Armed Forces job. Here, you have to answer this question based on your self reasoning. For example, if you say you had tried for NDA, you might be asked why you didn't clear your written/SSB. If you say you didn't try, they will ask what made you interested in defense now. ]
p => [ Try to answer honestly and give valid reasons to satisfy them. ]
h3 => [ 9) What would be your alternate career/study options if you could not qualify to join the armed forces? ]
p => [ This is a very tricky question. Most of the candidates tend to stick to the point that they will clear it, or they don't want to join anything else apart from the defense because it's their dream. Here, you have to be honest. It would be best if you had a backup plan. If you don't have one, choose one to answer this question.  ]
h3 => [ 10) What do you think that why were you not recommended in previous attempts?  ]
p => [ The interviewing officer asks this question to see whether you are well aware of your limitations/drawbacks and what you have done to improve them. He also wants to know how well prepare you are for this time. ]
p => [ So, while answering this question, you should state your mistakes that you had made in various tasks during their previous SSB attempts. Here, you have to focus on your improvements from the last attempt. You can point out that your performance during the ongoing SSB has been fair, according to you. ]
p => [  A Sample Answer:  Respected Sir, I realize that in my previous attempts, my physical strength and speaking skills were inadequate. I was not prepared well to serve my best. But, I can assure you that for the last six months, I am working hard on it, and now, I am so much more confident about myself. In this attempt, I have felt a significant change in my performance and realized the value of hard work and practice. ]
h3 => [ 11) Tell me about the competitive exams that you have appeared in chronological order.  ]
p => [ The interviewing officer asks this question to know about all the exams that you appeared for, their results, and the setbacks of you were not able to clear them. The interviewer may also ask if you had taken entrance coaching or not? And if you had taken entrance coaching, why you could not clear any of these exams.  ]
h3 => [ 12) Why do you want to join the defense forces? ]
p => [ The interviewer asks this question to see how you are excited about the defense service. He wants to examine your passion for defense service to convince him whether you are just another job seeker or a passionate defense aspirant. Here, you have to answer this question honestly. Just try to answer the innermost part of your heart. ]
p => [  A Sample Answer:  Respected Sir, I believe that the defense service is not just a job, but it is a way of life. It is one of the most dignified ways to lead the best life and to serve the nation. I have an extreme interest in the Indian army's heroic duty, adventure, and sports from my childhood, and thus I want to work in this field and serve my country. ]
h3 => [ 13) Tell me your marks you scored starting from your 10th till date. Also, state if you have any special achievements in them. Also, tell me about any extra-curricular activities that you have participated in during that time.  ]
p => [ This is the most famous question asked in the SSB interview. This is known as a rapid-fire round. Here, you have to tell your marks from the beginning in the proper sequence. The interviewing officer wants to see if you remember your past achievements or not by asking this question. This is important because starting from the 10th; everything was a turning point in your life till your graduation. So, you must know your 10th marks, 12th marks, and the marks of all the years of graduation, preferably semester-wise.  ]
h3 => [ 14) Will you come back again for an SSB interview if you fail this time? ]
p => [ The interviewing officer asks this question to check out your confidence. Don't worry or ever think that the interviewer is going to reject you. This question is just asked to see your anxiety, enthusiasm, and level of your nervousness. ]
p => [ Don't panic at this question. Just try to reply calmly and confidently with a positive attitude. Your answer should reflect your passion for this service. ]
p => [  A Sample Answer:  Respected Sir. I have come here for a reason, so I cannot quit and come back if I fail this time. After all, success is sure if efforts are true. ]
h3 => [ 15) Do you have a girlfriend/boyfriend? If not, then why?  ]
p => [ The interviewing officer asks this question to check your priority. He also wants to know how focused you are towards your goal and the topmost priorities of your life. It would be best if you were very honest while answering this question. Honesty is always the best policy. If you have a girlfriend, you can diplomatically tell them. For example, you can say that yes, sir, I have a girlfriend, and she is very supportive and encourages me for defense services all the time. Even today, she wished me the best of luck for this SSB interview. ]
p => [ If you don't have a girlfriend, you can deny it politely. Don't try to demonstrate yourself as a "Shakht Londa" or a macho man that you don't need a girlfriend and all that. ]
p => [  A Sample Answer:  Respected Sir. I have a lot of friends from school and college. Some are males, and some are females. They all are my very good friends. But, I don't have such a relationship with some particular girl. At present, my priority is the armed forces, and I want to make a career in it. For now, I am completely committed to it. ]
h3 => [ 16) Tell me the name of your girlfriend/boyfriend, two best friends, and what are the three qualities you like/dislike in them? ]
p => [ This is a very tricky question. The interviewing officer asks this question to see how you react when asked about your friends and their characteristics. By asking this question, the interviewer thinks that you will tell them your friends' weaknesses, and with the flow when you start criticizing them, he may ask yourself why you are still with them when they have these poor qualities. Because a person would be your friend if you see they do not lack any quality that your ideal friend must possess. So be very careful while answering this question. ]
h3 => [ 17) Tell me the three qualities of your best friend that you do not like. ]
p => [ By asking this question, the interviewing officer wants to examine your actual characteristics. He/she wants to know how much optimistic you are, how you take things, and more than that, how much you positively analyze things. ]
p => [ This is a very tricky question. When the interviewer asks this question, he wants you to tell him the drawbacks of your friend. The real challenge starts here because you have to make your answer optimistic while revealing your friends' flaws. You have to deal with it in such a way that the negative points also seem positive. ]
p => [  A Sample Answer:  Respected Sir. My best friend is Aryan, and he is an excellent artist who also does well in his academics, but the problem with him is the lack of concentration. He never utilizes time well, and this is what I always dislike about him. ]
p => [ The second problem is, being a topper of our school, he sometimes becomes overconfident about himself. I think confidence is reasonable but within limits. He can do much better with a proper level of confidence. ]
p => [ Thirdly, I appreciate him for such good computer skills, but at the same time, i think that he must spend some time in physical activities too as he is physically weak. ]
h3 => [ 18) Who is closer to you, your father or mother? Why? ]
p => [ By asking this tricky question, the interviewing officer wants to check your maturity, social intelligence, honesty, and how you tackle tough choices. This is not a one-word answer type question; rather than you should try to explain your answer in detail to justify your thoughts. ]
p => [  A Sample Answer:  Dear Sir, it is challenging to choose between them because I am close to both of them. I don't hesitate to communicate with either of them. But, since my father is mostly out for work, I speak more often with my mother. ]
h3 => [ 19) Do you watch porn? Are you addicted to it &amp; what do you do after watching porn? ]
p => [ This is a bizarre and sometimes awkward situation when someone asks you such type of question. By asking this question, the interviewing officer wants to know the candidate's capacity to keep oneself cool and compose in adverse and awkward situations. So while answering this question, if you should straightly say yes if you watch porn.  ]
p => [  A Sample Answer:  Yes, sir, I do watch porn sometimes. I am not addicted to it. Generally, I go for a running session or hit the gym right after watching porn because a high testosterone level helps me increasing the intensity of training. ]
h3 => [ 20) Tell me the five uses of a pen? ]
p => [ This is a type of situational question. The interviewing officer asks this question to test the candidate's attentiveness and alertness under stress and nervousness. ]

h3 => [ 21) Why has your percentage dropped from 10th to 12th?  ]
p => [ The interviewing officer generally asks this question if he finds a big percentage gap between your 10th and 12th exam marks. By asking this question, he doesn't want to discourage you. Instead, he wants to know that how much you have learned from your experience. While answering this question, you should mention some specific reasons, such as I was more influenced toward sports or I was so poor in time management, but at the same time, you have to make him believe that you have learned a good lesson from your failures and you have overcome them already. Don't try to blame anyone like your teachers or your friends for your poor marks. ]
p => [  A Sample Answer:  Sir, I think, at that time, I was not mature to understand the value of time. I had spent most of my time in the wrong direction. But, now I have learned the importance of time management. Time has taught me a lot, and now I am much more responsible than ever before. I think that poor marks in class 12th made me a better person and gave me the best life lesson to improve myself in wholesome. ]
