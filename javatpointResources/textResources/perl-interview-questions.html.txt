h1 => [ Perl Interview Questions ]
h3 => [ 1) What is Perl? ]
p => [  Perl stands for  P ractical  E xtraction and  R eporting  L anguage. It is a high-level programming language written by Larry Wall, specially designed for processing text. It supports object-oriented programming, and its syntax is quite similar to C language. It is much more flexible to use. Due to its strong text processing abilities, it has become one of the most popular languages for writing CGI scripts. ]
