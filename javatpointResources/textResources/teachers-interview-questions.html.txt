h1 => [ Most Asked Teachers Interview Questions ]
p => [ Following is a list of most frequently asked teachers Interview questions and their best possible answers. ]
h3 => [ 1) Why do you want to become a teacher? / Why do you want to work with children? ]
p => [ This is probably the first and most common interview question for teachers. The school administrators' interview panel wants to know that you are motivated enough to work through inevitable frustrations. The school administration wants to know completely about you as an individual and as an educator by asking this question. You have to make it clear here what you can bring to the school. While answering this question, you can say that I always wanted to be a teacher because I want to help people, but this is a very common answer, and it won't be effective. You should find something specific that shows you are motivated like no other. ]
strong => [ A Sample Example: ]
p => [ In my school days, I was a very shy, introvert, and weak student. I have some problems reading long sentences. One of my teachers introduced me to an amazing list of short stories and books. Her style of teaching was unique and playful. She read to us and worked with us on reading comprehension. Her care switched on an unquenchable thirst that led me to read thousands of books on topics as diverse as history, biology, sociology, and nature. That teachers' attention forever changed my thinking towards society. Since then, I have always wanted to do exactly what she did to us. That's why I wanted to be a teacher. ]
h3 => [ 2) What is your teaching style or philosophy? /What adjectives would you use to describe your presence in the classroom? ]
p => [ By asking this question, the interviewers want to check that are you a good fit for their school?

Here, you have to clear that you care about people and their success, not just your professional achievements. ]
p => [  A Sample Answer:  I believe in teaching each student's passion. I give attention to every student and try to enhance their passion by delivering structured lessons. ]
p => [  Sample Answer Two:  You can say that I am strict, but it is fair when teaching. When students are challenged with realistic goals and given the support, they need not just get the answers right but also use those learning to solve future problems on their own. As a teacher, I believe that it is my job to support my students through their lessons. I also have to stay strong with my students with various challenges they may face at school. I have to partner with them and other support systems to help them feel motivated, comfortable, and happy in the classroom. ]
h3 => [ 3) How much do you want to know about your students to be most helpful to them?  ]

p => [  A Sample Answer:  First, I try to know the student's learning styles, passions, and challenges and then try to get involved with them. For example, in my previous school, there was a child who was disruptive in class. I joined him on the playground on and off. I found out he was being bullied after school by his brother's friends. I spoke with his parents, and they had no idea. After that, he became a good student, and as a result, my whole class got quieter and easier to teach. ]
