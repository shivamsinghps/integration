h3 => [ 1) What is PySpark? / What do you know about PySpark? ]
p => [ PySpark is a tool or interface of Apache Spark developed by the Apache Spark community and Python to support Python to work with Spark. This tool collaborates with Apache Spark using APIs written in Python to support features like Spark SQL, Spark DataFrame, Spark Streaming, Spark Core, Spark MLlib, etc. It provides an interactive PySpark shell to analyze structured and semi-structured data in a distributed environment and process them by providing optimized APIs that help the program to read data from various data sources. PySpark features are implemented in the py4j library in Python. Due to the availability of the Py4j library, it facilitates users to work with RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) in the Python programming language. Python supports many libraries that support big data processing and machine learning. ]

h3 => [ 3) What is RDD in PySpark? ]
p => [ In PySpark, RDD is an acronym that stands for Resilient Distributed Datasets. It is a core data structure of PySpark. It is a low-level object that is highly efficient in performing distributed tasks. ]
p => [ The PySpark's RDDs are the elements that can run and operate on multiple nodes to do parallel processing on a cluster. These are immutable elements. It means that if you once create an RDD, you cannot change it. RDDs are also fault-tolerant. In the case of any failure, they recover automatically. We can apply multiple operations on RDDs to achieve a certain task. ]

It enhances the execution speed as transformations on partitioned data run quicker because each partition's transformations are executed in parallel. PySpark supports both partitioning in memory (DataFrame) and partitioning on disc (File system). When we make a DataFrame from a file or table, PySpark creates the DataFrame in memory with a specific number of divisions based on specified criteria. ]
p => [ It also facilitates us to create a partition on multiple columns using partitionBy() by passing the columns you want to partition as an argument to this method. ]
strong => [ Syntax: ]
p => [ In PySpark, it is recommended to have 4x of partitions to the number of cores in the cluster available for application. ]
h3 => [ 20) What do you understand by PySpark DataFrames? ]
p => [ PySpark DataFrames are the distributed collection of well-organized data. These are the same as relational databases tables and are placed into named columns. PySpark DataFrames are better optimized than R or Python programming language because these can be created from different sources like Hive Tables, Structured Data Files, existing RDDs, external databases, etc. ]
p => [ The biggest advantage of PySpark DataFrame is that the data in the PySpark DataFrame is distributed across different machines in the cluster, and the operations performed on this would be run parallel on all the machines.
