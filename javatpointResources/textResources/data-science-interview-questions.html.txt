p => [  When we work with a supervised machine learning algorithm, the model learns from the training data. The model always tries to best estimate the mapping function between the output variable(Y) and the input variable(X). The estimation for target function may generate the prediction error, which can be divided mainly into  Bias error , and  Variance error . These errors can be explained as: ]
