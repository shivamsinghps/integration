h2 => [ 1) Differentiate between for loop and while loop in C? ]
p => [ In C language, both 'for' loop and 'while' loop are used to repeatedly executing a set of instructions.  ]
strong => [ The main differences between both the loops are given below: ]
th => [ For loop ]
th => [ While loop ]
strong => [ for loop ]
strong => [ while loop ]
strong => [ for loop ]
strong => [ while loop ]
td => [ If the condition is not given in for loop, then it will execute for infinite times. ]
td => [ If the condition is not given in while loop, then it will give the compilation error. ]
td => [ In for loop iteration, statement is written at the top of the loop so it will execute when all the loop body statements are executed. ]
td => [ In while loop, the iteration statement can be placed anywhere inside the loop. ]
h2 => [ 2) Define Null pointer and where can we use it? ]
p => [ In reference to the computer memory, a Null pointer is a pointer which points to an empty location. Or Null pointer is a pointer which points to nothing. ]
strong => [ Following are the primary uses of the NULL pointer in C language: ]
li => [ We mostly use a Null pointer to show the end of memory search.  ]
li => [ We can pass a NULL pointer as a function argument when we don?t want to pass a valid memory address. ]
h2 => [ 3) What is static and dynamic binding? ]
p => [ Binding is a process of associating a method call with method definition. ]
strong => [ The Binding in Java is of two types: ]
li => [ Static Binding ]
li => [ Dynamic Binding ]
p => [  Static Binding:  If the type of object can be determined at compile-time by compiler then it is known as static binding. ]
p => [  Dynamic Binding:  If the type of object can be determined at runtime by compiler then it is called as dynamic binding. ]
h2 => [ 4) Explain polymorphism in Java? ]
p => [ Polymorphism in Java is one of the OOPs concepts, which defines that an action can be performed in different ways. In Java, Polymorphism enables a method or object to be used in various forms.  ]
strong => [ Polymorphism is of two types: ]
li => [ Compile-time polymorphism ]
li => [ Runtime polymorphism ]
p => [ We can achieve polymorphism in Java by method overloading and method overriding. ]
h2 => [ 5) What are the various types of Polymorphism? ]
p => [ Polymorphism in Java is of two types: ]
li => [ Static polymorphism ]
li => [ Dynamic polymorphism ]
p => [  Static Polymorphism:  Static polymorphism is also termed as compile-time polymorphism because static polymorphism can be resolved at compile time. We can achieve static polymorphism through method overloading. Which means in a class there are more than one method which has the same name but different parameter, or return type or the number of parameters.  ]
p => [  Dynamic Polymorphism:  Dynamic polymorphism is also known as dynamic method dispatch or runtime polymorphism. Dynamic polymorphism is a process in which call to an overridden method can be resolved at runtime instead of compile time, hence it is also known as late binding. In dynamic polymorphism, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of the superclass. ]
h2 => [ 6) Differentiate between malloc () and calloc () function? ]
p => [ The malloc() and calloc(), both functions are used for dynamic memory allocation in C language but there are some differences between them: ]
th => [ malloc() ]
th => [ calloc() ]
td => [ 1.	malloc() function needs only one argument for memory allocation. ]
td => [ Calloc() function needs two arguments for memory allocation. ]
td => [ 2.	malloc() function is used to assign a single block of required memory. ]
td => [ Calloc() function is used to assign multiple blocks of required memory.  ]
td => [ 3.	malloc() doesn't initialize the allocated memory.  ]
td => [ calloc() function initializes the allocated memory to zero. ]
td => [ 4.	The memory allocation speed is fast than calloc() function. ]
td => [ The memory allocation speed is slow than malloc() function.  ]
h2 => [ 7) Write a program to swap two numbers without using any third variable? ]
strong => [ Output: ]
h2 => [ 8) Differentiate between Set and List? ]
p => [ The Set and List, both are the interfaces which extend the Collection interface.  ]
strong => [ The primary differences between Set and List are given below: ]
th => [ Set ]
th => [ List ]
td => [ The Set interface is an unordered collection of data elements ]
td => [ The List interface is an ordered collection of data elements. ]
td => [ The Set interface does not contain any duplicate element, i.e., it only holds unique elements. ]
td => [ The List interface can include duplicate elements ]
td => [ The Set interface does not maintain insertion order, or it can store elements in sorted order. ]
td => [ The List interface maintains insertion order of data elements, that means element will store in the order in which they are inserted. ]
td => [ The primary implementation of the Set interface are HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet. ]
td => [ The primary implementations of the List interface are ArrayList, Vector, and LinkedList. ]
h2 => [ 9) What is copy constructor and assignment operator? ]
p => [  Copy Constructor:  Copy constructor is a constructor which creates an object by initializing it with a previously created object of same class.  ]
p => [ It is called as a copy constructor because it has the same name as class name and it creates a copy of the previously created object. ]
h3 => [ Syntax ]
p => [  Assignment Operator:  Assignment operator is an operator which is called when an already initialized object is assigned a new value from another previously created object. ]
h3 => [ Syntax ]
h2 => [ 10) What do you understand by Data Definition Language in SQL? ]
p => [ The SQL is a database language, by which we can perform various operations on an already created database. We can also create a new database with the help of various commands. These commands are categorized into four ways, one of them is DDL, which is termed as data definition language.  ]
p => [ DDL contains such commands which are used for defining the database schema. It deals with the description of database schema and specifies the way of putting data in the database. ]
strong => [ Following are some commands used by DDL: ]
strong => [ CREATE: ]
strong => [ ALTER: ]
strong => [ DROP: ]
strong => [ TRUNCATE: ]
strong => [ COMMENT: ]
strong => [ RENAME: ]
h2 => [ 11) What do you understand by TRUNC and ROUND function? ]
p => [  TRUNC()  function: The TRUNC() function is used to truncate or delete the certain number right to the decimal without rounding off. ]
h3 => [ Syntax ]
strong => [ Where, n = return a truncated number ]
strong => [ decimal_number= nth of decimal place to truncated. ]
h3 => [ Example ]
p => [  ROUND ()  function: The ROUND() function is used to round-off any input value to its nearest integer value or the defined number of decimal points.  ]
h3 => [ Syntax: ]
p => [ Where n= return a rounded number ]
p => [ decimal_number= It specifies the nth decimal place. ]
h3 => [ Example ]
h2 => [ 12) Define inheritance in Java? ]
p => [  Inheritance in Java is an OOP's concept by which one class can inherit the property (fields and methods) and behaviour of other class. With the help of inheritance in Java, we can increase the reusability of methods and fields as one class can use the methods and fields of another class.  ]
p => [ Inheritance shows the IS-A relationship which is a parent-child relationship. ]
strong => [ Following are some important points of inheritance in Java: ]
li => [ A class which inherits the property of another class is called as child class/derived class, or subclass.  ]
li => [ A class whose properties got inherited by another class is known as parent class/ Superclass.  ]
li => [ To inherit a class by another class, we use 'extend' keyword. ]
h3 => [ Syntax: ]
h2 => [ 13) Differentiate between overloading and overriding? ]
th => [ Method Overloading ]
th => [ Method Overriding ]
td => [ When methods of the same class have the same name but different parameters or different return type, it is called method overloading. ]
td => [ When the subclass has the same method as superclass method which contains the exact same name, same parameter and same return type, then it is called method overriding. ]
td => [ We can achieve compile-time polymorphism with method overloading. ]
td => [ We can achieve runtime polymorphism with method overriding. ]
td => [ To obtain method overloading, methods must be of same class ]
td => [ To obtain method overriding, methods must have a parent-child relationship. ]
td => [ The method parameters must be different in method overloading. ]
td => [ The method parameter must be same in method overriding. ]
td => [ In Method overloading, return type can be of the same type or of different type. ]
td => [ In method overriding, return type must be of the same type. ]
h2 => [ 14)	What do you understand by normalization? ]
p => [ Database normalization is a mechanism of organizing data in database tables in an easier way that there should be no data redundancy. It increases data integrity. It is a multistep process which puts data in tabular form in the relational database and removes duplicate data. ]
h2 => [ 15) Write code to check that a number is palindrome or not? ]
strong => [ Output: ]
h2 => [ 16) Can we achieve runtime polymorphism in Java only? ]
p => [ No, we can achieve runtime polymorphism in other languages also such as C++, C#, etc. ]
h2 => [ 17) What do you understand by virtual function? ]
p => [ A virtual function in C++ is a member function of the base class, which is redefined in the derived class. To create a virtual function, 'virtual' keyword is used. The purpose of the virtual function is to tell the compiler to perform the dynamic dispatch on function. ]
h2 => [ 18. Write a program to add two numbers without using arithmetic addition operator. ]
strong => [ Output: ]
h2 => [ 19) What is Default case in the Switch statement? ]
p => [ The default keyword in switch case is a special term. If in a switch statement, no case satisfies the input condition then the default case will be executed and will give the corresponding output. ]
h2 => [ 20) Differentiate between the Switch Statement and if else statement? ]
p => [ Both switch statement and if-else statement are used for selection of statement for a particular condition. ]
strong => [ Main differences between both are given below: ]
th => [ SWITCH statement ]
th => [ IF-ELSE statement ]
td => [ The execution of the statement is decided by the user. ]
td => [ The execution of the statement depends upon the output of expression given inside if statement. ]
td => [ The switch statement uses single expression for multiple selections. ]
td => [ The If-else statement uses multiple statements for multiple choices. ]
td => [ A Switch statement can only evaluate the character or integer value. ]
td => [ If-else statement can evaluate integer, float, character, pointer, or Boolean values. ]
td => [ In switch statement, one case will be executed and then another if there is no any break statement. ]
td => [ In if-else statement, either if statement will be executed or else statement. ]
h2 => [ 21) Why database is considered as self- describing? ]
p => [ One of the characteristics of the database is that it is self-describing. It is considered as self-describing because it contains data with metadata which describes the relationship between data and tables in the particular database. Hence, database self-describes itself with the help of metadata. ]
h2 => [ 22) What do you understand by ConcurrentMap? ]
p => [ The ConcurrentMap is an Interface, which extends Map interface. The ConcurrentMap interface is a member of the Java Collections framework. It is capable of handling concurrent access and provide thread safety. ]
h3 => [ Syntax ]
p => [ Where K and V are the parameters, which represents  ]
p => [ K= the type of Keys  ]
p => [ V= the type of value mapped with Keys ]
h2 => [ 23) What do you understand by Paging in OS? ]
p => [ In Operating System, Paging is a technique used for memory management. By this technique, OS stores and retrieve the data from secondary memory to main memory in same sized blocks, which are termed as pages. ]
strong => [ Paging is used for the following benefits in OS: ]
li => [ Paging allows faster access of data when required.  ]
li => [ Paging is very useful for virtual memory implementation. ]
h2 => [ 24) What do you understand by Hashtable? ]
p => [ In Java, Hashtable is a class which implements hash table data structure. It maps keys to value. For retrieving and storing objects from a Hashtable, every object which is used as a key, must implement the hashcode method and equals method.  ]
strong => [ Following are some main points for Hashtable: ]
li => [ A Hashtable is an array of the list, which is termed as a bucket. To identify the position of the bucket we need to call the hashcode() method.  ]
li => [ Hashtable class contains unique elements in the list.  ]
li => [ It is the same as HashMap, but it is synchronized.  ]
h3 => [ Syntax ]
h2 => [ 25) What is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS? ]
p => [ The DBMS and RDBMS both are used for storing the information. RDBMS is an advanced version of DBMS but there are some differences between both the databases:  ]
th => [ DBMS ]
th => [ RDBMS ]
td => [ It stands for the Database Management System. ]
td => [ It stands for Relational Database Management System. ]
td => [ DBMS stores data in the form of files. ]
td => [ RDBMS stores data in tabular form. ]
td => [ Normalization does not occur in DBMS. ]
td => [ Normalization occurs in RDBMS. ]
td => [ In DMBS, data is stored in file system hence there is not any relation occurs between tables. ]
td => [ In RDBMS, data is stored in tabular form hence there is a relation between the tables. ]
td => [ DBMS only supports one user at a time. ]
td => [ RDBMS supports multiple users at a time. ]
td => [ DBMS can handle a small amount of data. ]
td => [ RDBMS can handle a large amount of data. ]
h2 => [ 26) What is join in SQL? What are its types? ]
p => [ A Join statement in SQL is used to combine the data or rows from two or more different tables if they satisfy the given join condition. The minimum joining condition is (n-1) for joining tables where n is number of tables. To perform a join operation in SQL, we use JOIN keyword. ]
strong => [ Types of Join in SQL: ]
strong => [ There are four types of Join in SQL which are: ]
li => [ Inner Join ]
li => [ Outer Join ]
li => [ Left Join ]
li => [ Right join. ]
h2 => [ 27) What do you understand by the interface and abstract class? ]
p => [  Interface:  Interface is like a class which has methods and variables, but all the methods declared in an Interface are abstract in nature. Interface in Java is a way to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance. ]
p => [ To declare an interface in Java, we use 'interface' keyword. With the help of interface, we can achieve complete abstraction. ]
h3 => [ Syntax ]
p => [  Abstract class:  Use of an abstract class is another way to achieve abstraction in Java. For the creation of an abstract class, an 'abstract' keyword is used. With an abstract class, we can achieve complete or partial abstraction, which means it can have abstract or non-abstract methods. An abstract class cannot be instantiated. ]
h3 => [ Syntax ]
h2 => [ 28) Differentiate between static and init block in Java? ]
p => [ Static block is only executed at the first time of creation of a class object by JVM whereas init block is executed at every time whenever JVM creates the class Object. If in a class both static and init blocks are given then firstly static block will be executed and then init block.  ]
h3 => [ Example: ]
strong => [ Output: ]
