p => [  Quad 
Quad8 
ODE23 
ODE45 ]
h3 => [ 14) What is latex in MATLAB? ]
p => [ MATLAB already deals naturally with simple latex encoding that enables introducing Greek letters or changing the font size and displays in plots. ]
h3 => [ 15) What do you mean by M-file in MATLAB? ]
p => [ M-files are nothing but just a plain ASCII script that is interpreted at run time. We can say these are the subprograms stored in text files with .m extensions and are known as M-files. M-files are used for most of the MATLAB development, and platform independence and maintainability. It is parsed once and "just-in-time" compiled, but it is also transparent to the customer. ]

h3 => [ 16) What are the MEX files? ]
p => [ MEX files are native C or C++ files that is dynamically connected directly into the MATLAB application at runtime. It allows using C, C++, and Fortran programs in MATLAB. They must be compiled for each hardware structure on which they are to be run. ]
h3 => [ 17) What are the standard toolboxes present in MATLAB and how these toolboxes can be accessed? ]
strong => [ Various types of toolboxes available are: ]
li => [ Control Systems ]
li => [ Fuzzy Logic ]
li => [ Image Processing ]

li => [ Neural Networks ]
li => [ Optimization ]
li => [ Partial Differential Equation ]
li => [ Robust Control ]

h3 => [ 18) How to Correctly Apply the Graphics Patches in MATLAB? ]
p => [ Open a LOCAL MACHINE window and type: xhost +ashland # Add the following code series just before the plot function that was giving our problems: figure? set(gcf,'renderer','zbuffer') ? [s, w] = unix ('echo $DISPLAY') ? set (gcf,'XDisplay', w) ? ]

p => [  Pseudorandom binary sequence:  A form of creating an M-file in the new Frequency Domain System Identification Toolbox, for a specified set of lengths (2^2-1 to 2^30-1) is called a pseudo-random binary sequence. It is also called a  mlbs  (Maximum Length, Binary Sequence). ]
p => [  Numeric precision:  Numeric quantities that are represented as double-precision floating-point numbers is called numeric precision. In systems, such numbers have 53 significant binary bits, which is about 15 or 16 decimal digits. ]
h3 => [ 21) Can We Run MATLAB without Graphics? ]
p => [ Sometimes we may want to run scripts that involve plotting commands without showing the plots and without going into the script to comment out the commands. ]
p => [  An example: if we are working from home and it's too slow to run graphics over the network. We can play a simple UNIX trick: 
%setenv DISPLAY /dev/null % matlab ]
h3 => [ 22) What is a P-code? ]
p => [ Pcode is a prepared and encoded version of the M-file. It stores the load time of the function. This is most likely not an issue except for very high M-files since most are parsed only once anyway. Pcode also lets us hide the source code from others. There is no way to change Pcode back to the M-file source. Pcode is platform-independent. ]
h3 => [ 23) Explain about the mentioned tools in MATLAB: who, whos, pi, eps, type. ]
p => [  Who:  It will show you all the variables you have currently defined. ]
p => [  whos:  It will show you the variables, their sizes, and some other info. ]
p => [  pi:  It is a function that returns the equation of pi. ]
p => [  eps:  It is a function that returns MATLAB?s lowest floating-point number. This is useful if we have a vector that might include zeros that are going to wind up in the denominator of something. If we add eps to the vector, you aren't adding anything significant, but we won't run into a divide by zero problems anymore ]
p => [  Type:  function name for any function in MATLAB?s search path lets us see how that function is written. ]
h3 => [ 24) What Is Stress Analysis in MATLAB? ]
p => [ MATLAB is used in aerospace engineering, space environment. ]
p => [ MATLAB is suitable for flexible dynamics. ]
p => [ These domain experts conduct stress analysis on various operations like metallic and composite structures. ]
p => [ To analyze the stress, NASTRAN, IDEAD, Oracle, and PATRAN levels of proficiency are required. ]
p => [ The functions are also used on aircraft that is metallic structure. ]
p => [ The stress analysis contains control surface stiffness understanding, loop evaluation, finite item modeling, and fatigue testing requirement and analysis. ]
h3 => [ 25) How can the source code can be executed on MATLAB? ]
p => [ By default, the code is generally stored with in (.m) extension, which is anchored however if the customer needs it to be put away in a more anchored way then he can attempt the accompanying methods: ]
