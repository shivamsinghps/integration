p => [  Callout:  The callout is used to receive the messages and call the requested services and operations. For every connected target operation, there is a callout node in the median flow. In the case of a successful call, the callout response node in the response flow receives a response message. If the call is unsuccessful, the callout is set to retry service invocations according to the type of fault received. ]
p => [  Service Invoke:  The Service Invoke is used to make a service request. It would either be a request or a response to a mediation flow. The service can be a request/response or a one-way. A series of service invocations are performed after permitting the multiple instances of a service to invoke primitives in a flow. ]

p => [ When a Batch Job scope is initiated within an application, it splits messages into individual records. It performs actions upon each record, and then reports on the results are pushed the processed output to other systems or queues. Using this, we can handle a huge quantity of incoming data from an API into a legacy system. We can also synchronize data sets between business applications. ]

p => [ Mule Transformer or Mulesoft Transformer is an event instance used to refer to a library, org.mule.api.MuleEvent. This is used to carry the messages with the event. The main aim of the Mule transformer is to create a chain of transformers.  ]
h3 => [ 25) What are the Models in Mulesoft studio? ]
p => [ In Mulesoft studio, the grouping of services, i.e., application objects and their created attributes, are called Models. Models enable a user to start and stop the services inside a given model. ]
h3 => [ 26) What is API in Mulesoft, and what are its main features?  ]

h3 => [ 42) What do you understand by Endpoints in Mule? ]
p => [ In Mule, Endpoints are used to specify a particular usage of a protocol. It is used for polling, reading from, or writing to a destination. ]
p => [ It is also used to control what underlying entities would be used with a dependent connector. ]
h3 => [ 43) How can we achieve reliability in Mulesoft? ]
p => [ In Mulesoft, reliability means zero message loss. So, if you want to achieve reliability, then your application must be designed to capture the state of a running process/instance, which another running node in the cluster can pick up. ]
p => [ Reliable messaging is achieved by the built-in support of transactions in transport if the application uses a transactional transport such as Java Message Service (JMS), Virtual Machine (VM), Database (DB), etc. A reliable messaging pattern is mandatory if we are dealing with non-transactional endpoints. ]
h3 => [ 44) What is a component in Mule? ]
p => [ Components are used to perform an important role in Mulesoft services. Every service in Mulesoft consists of core components and core and inbound and outbound routers. Components are also used to implement behavior in service. They can be very simple, like logging messages or invoking other services. ]
h3 => [ 45) What do you understand by Flow and Subflow in Mule?  ]
p => [  Flow:  In Mule, flow occurs when we combine multiple individual processors to handle a receipt, processing, and the eventual routing of a message. We can connect several flows to build one complete application. Then, we can deploy this application on Mule, on-premise, another app server, or on the cloud. A message entering a flow can pass through a large variety of processors. After receiving the message through a request-response inbound endpoint, Mule transforms the content into a new format. The business logic is then processed in a component before returning a response through the message source. ]
p => [  Subflow:  We can call the subflow by using the flow-reference element of Mule. When the subflow is called using a flow-reference element by the main flow, the entire message structure, i.e., attachments, payload, properties, etc., are passed along with the context. Subflows are very useful when adding re-usable logic, as we can call sub-flows multiple times. It can also enhance performance in comparison to flow. ]
h3 => [ 46) What is the full form of TSD in Mule? ]
p => [ TSD is an acronym that stands for Transport Service Descriptor. It is a connector used for technical configuration. It is used to define classes name used for message receivers, dispatchers, and requesters. Its default value may be changed according to the behavior of transport.  ]
h3 => [ 47) What are the main differences between Flow and Subflow in Mule? ]

th => [ Flow ]
th => [ Subflow ]
td => [ A flow follows its strategy for exception handling, and it also does not have a source defined. ]
td => [ A subflow is used to process messages synchronously, and it follows the strategy of processing and exception handling from the calling flow. ]

td => [ Subflow doesn't support error handling, and it inherits the error handling strategy from parent flow.  ]
td => [ The performance of referring flows is not as good as compared to subflow. ]
td => [ Referring subflow gives better performance as compared to flow. ]
h3 => [ 48) What are the main characteristics of the global endpoint? ]
