td => [ Unit type ]
td => [ It is used if other data types are not specified. ]
h3 => [ 4) What is the unit type in F#? ]
p => [ The unit type is a type which indicates the absence of specific value. The unit type has only a single value. This value acts as a placeholder when no other value exist. ]
strong => [ Example: ]
h3 => [ 5) What is upcasting and downcasting in F#? ]
p => [ Casting is a process of converting one type to another type. F# provides mainly two operators to deal with upcasting and downcasting. The :&gt; operator is used to upcast object and :?&gt; operator is used to downcast object. ]
strong => [ Example: ]
h3 => [ 6) What are available operators in F#? ]

p => [ In F#, functions can be composed from other functions. It is a process of composing in which a function represents the application of two composed functions. F# function pipelining allows us to call functions in the chain. Pipelining operator takes a function and an argument as operands and returns a value. ]
h4 => [ F# Function Composition Example ]
h4 => [ F# Function Pipelining Example ]
h3 => [ 9) What is lambda expression in F#? ]
p => [  Lambda expression is an unnamed or anonymous function. Sometimes instead of defining a full name function, you may create a lambda expression. It optimizes the code. You must use a  fun  keyword to define lambda expression. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 10) What is an inline function in F#? ]
p => [ The F# inline function is a function that is integrated directly into the calling code. It helps to optimize code and sometimes can improve performance too. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 11) What is let bindings in F#? ]
p => [ Binding is a process of associating of identifier or function to a value. Let keyword is used to bind an identifier to a value. In F#, We use let keyword to declare variable, function and private class members. ]
h4 => [ F# Let binding in function ]
p => [ We use let keyword to define a function in F#. ]
h3 => [ 12) What is "do bindings" in F#? ]
p => [ Do binding is used to execute code without defining a function or any type. You can write independent code by using do binding in F#. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 13) What is type annotation in F#? ]
p => [ F# allows type annotation so that you can explicitly mention the type of identifier or parameter or return type of a function. You must use: (colon) to apply annotation in F#. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 14) What is Type Inference in F#? ]
p => [ Type inference means when you are writing code then you don't need to specify the type of values or variables. F# compiler is strong enough to infer the type of value. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 15) What is Automatic Generalization in F#? ]
p => [ When code does not specify any type explicitly, then the compiler considers generic type. It is called an automatic generalization. It helps to write generic code without increasing complexity. ]
h3 => [ 16) What are the Tuples in F#? ]
p => [ In F#, tuples are a collection of anonymous values. Values may be the same or different types. It allows us to put expression as a value also. ]

h3 => [ 21) What are the options in F#? ]
p => [  Options type is used when there is no value present for function or variable. It provides an expression  Some  and a value  None  for handling the empty values or variables. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 22) What is Generics in F#? ]
p => [ F# allows you to write a generic function, method, type, variable, etc. It helps to avoid repeating of code for each type. By writing generic code, you can apply it for any type or value. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 23) What are the Records in F#? ]
p => [ Records are used to store elements in the form of label and value. It can store any data. You are not bound to store same type values as a list. Records are immutable by default so you can't modify original records. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 24) What is Enumeration in F#? ]
p => [ Enumeration is popularly known as enums. It is a combination of label and value pair. Labels are assigned to a subset of the values. You can use them in place of literals to make the code more readable and maintainable. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 25) What are Reference cells in F#? ]
p => [ Reference cells refer to memory locations. It allows you to create mutable values. F# uses immutable data structure by default. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 26) What is a structure in F#? ]
p => [  The F# structure is a data structure which is used to organize data, and it is value types and efficient than class. It does not allow let binding, so you must declare fields by using  val  keyword. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 27) What is Discriminated Union in F#? ]
p => [ It is a useful data structure. It helps to store heterogeneous data. The Union is used to represent tree data structures. It provides cases, and each case consists of heterogeneous data. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 28) What is Object in F#? ]
p => [ The Object is a real-world entity. It can be anything like - cell phone, car, football, etc. ]
p => [ The Object is an instance of the class we can access all the members of the class by using object of this class. ]
strong => [ Let's see an example of how to create an object in F#. ]
h3 => [ 29) What is a class in F#? ]
p => [ The Class is a template or blueprint of an object. It is used to encapsulate data members and member methods. It can contain fields, methods, constructor, static method, etc. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 30) What is a constructor in F#? ]
p => [ In F#, Constructor is somewhat different than other .Net languages. There are always primary constructors that may or may not have parameters. The Scope of these parameters is throughout the class. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 31) What is a self in F#? ]
p => [ In F#, a self is used to refer the current object of class type. Self is the same as this keyword in C# and Java. You can name the self-identifier however you want. You are not restricted to names such as this or self as in .Net languages. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 32) What is static in F#? ]
p => [ In F#, static is a keyword. It is used to make the static field or static method. Static is not the part of the object. It has its memory space to store static data. It is used to share common properties among objects. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 33) What is an inheritance in F#? ]
p => [ In F#, inheritance is a process in which child class acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent class automatically. It is used to reuse the code. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 34) What is method overriding in F#? ]
p => [ Method overriding is a feature of Object-oriented programming approach. It helps to achieve polymorphism. We can achieve method overriding using inheritance. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 35) What is an abstract class? ]
p => [ Abstract classes are used to provide the full implementation of class members. It may contain non-abstract methods. A class that inherits abstract class must provide an implementation of all abstract methods of the abstract class. ]
h4 => [ Example ]
