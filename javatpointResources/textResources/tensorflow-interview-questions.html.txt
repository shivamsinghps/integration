p => [  A list of top frequently asked  TensorFlow Interview Questions and Answers  are given below.  ]
h3 => [ 1) What is TensorFlow? ]
p => [  TensorFlow is a  Python -based library which is used for creating machine learning applications. It is a low-level toolkit to perform complex mathematics. It offers users the customizability option to build experimental learning architectures. It also helps the users to work with them, and to turn them into running software. It was initially created by researchers and engineers working on the  Google Brain Team , and It became open source in 2015. ]
p => [  TensorFlow is made up of two words  Tensor  and  Flow ; a tensor is known as data representation for multi-dimensional array and flow means a series of operations performed on tensors. ]
h3 => [ 2) What do you know about Tensors? ]
p => [  The Tensor is a generalization of vectors or matrices of the n-dimensional array which is used in computer programming. It represents a multitude of data in the form of numbers. There are few other n-dimensional array libraries which are available on the internet such as  Numpy , but TensorFlow stands apart from those libraries. It provides methods to create tensor functions and automatically compute derivatives. ]
p => [  A graph can conduct all operations in the Tensor. We can say that the edge of the node is known as Tensor. We need a feature vector as the initial input to implement a Tensor.

It is arranged with the oldest timestep in the back, and the most recent timestep in front. ]
p => [ If a Histogram mode is changed from "offset" to "overlay", the perspective will rotate. As a result, every histogram slice is rendered as a line and overlaid with one another. ]

p => [  The Distribution Dashboard is another way that is used to visualize histogram data from t f.summary.histogram . It displays some high-level statistics on a distribution. Each line on the chart is used to represent a percentile in the distribution over the data. For example, the bottom line displays how the minimum value changes over time and the line in the middle displays how the median changes.

h3 => [ 50) What is the difference between Tensor.eval() and Session.run()? ]
p => [ In TensorFlow, we create graphs and provide values to that graph. The graph itself processes all the hardwork and generates the output based on the configuration that we have applied in the graph. Now, when we provide values to the graph, then first, we need to create a TensorFlow session. ]
p => [ Once the session is initialized, then we are supposed to use that session. It is necessary because all the variables and settings are now part of the session. ]
p => [ So, there are two possible ways that we can apply to pass external values to the graph so that the graph accepts them.  ]
strong => [ .run() ]
strong => [ .eval() ]
p => [  At the place of  [object Object] , we can put  [object Object]  and It will provide the same behavior. Here, eval is using the default session and then executing run(). ]
