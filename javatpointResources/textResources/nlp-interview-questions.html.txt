h3 => [ 20) What is Lemmatization in Natural Language Processing? ]
p => [ Lemmatization is a process of doing things properly using a vocabulary and morphological analysis of words. It is mainly used to remove the inflectional endings only and return the base or dictionary form of a word, known as the lemma. It is just like cutting down your beard or shaving to get the original shape of your face. ]
p => [  For example:  girl's = girl, bikes= bike, leaders= leader etc. ]
p => [ So, the main task of Lemmatization is to identify and return the root or original words of the sentence to explore various additional information. ]
h3 => [ 21) What is Stemming in Natural Language Processing? ]
p => [ Stemming is a process of extracting the base form of a word by removing the affixes from them. It is just like cutting down the branches of a tree to its stems. ]
p => [  For example:  After stemming, the words go, goes, and going would be 'go'. ]
p => [ Search engines use stemming for indexing the words. It facilitates them to store only the stems rather than storing all forms of a word. By using stemming, the search engines reduce the size of the index and increase the retrieval accuracy. ]
h3 => [ 22) What is the difference between Stemming and Lemmatization in NLP? ]
p => [ Stemming and Lemmatization are both the text normalization techniques used in Natural language Processing. Both are used to prepare text, words, and documents for further processing.
