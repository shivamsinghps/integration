p => [ Local lookup file contains documentation or data records that can be settled in the major or main memory. It can be used to retrieve records much faster than it retrieves data from a disk. For this, transform functions are used by Local lookup.  ]
h3 => [ 29) What is the difference between the sandbox and EME? Can we perform checkin and checkout through sandbox? ]
p => [ Sandbox is a work area used to develop, test, or run code associated with a given project.

h3 => [ 31) What is the difference between check point and phase in Ab Initio? ]
p => [ A list of differences between check point and phase in Ab Initio:  ]
th => [ Check point ]
th => [ Phase ]
td => [ A check point is a recovery point that is created when a graph fails in the middle of the process. ]
td => [ A graph consists of phases. If a graph is created with phases, each phase is assigned to some part of the memory. ]
td => [ The rest of the process will be continued after the check point. ]
td => [ All the phases run one by one. ]
td => [ Data from the check point is fetched and continues to execute after correction. ]
td => [ In phase, the intermediate file will be deleted. ]
h3 => [ 32) What do you understand by the rollup component? How can you do it? ]
p => [ Rollup is a way to group the records on a particular field. If a user wants to group the records on particular field values, rollup is the best way. It is a multi-stage transform function that contains the following mandatory functions. ]
li => [ Initialise ]
li => [ Rollup ]
li => [ Finalise ]
h3 => [ 33) What is the difference between scientific data processing and commercial data processing? ]
p => [ In scientific data processing, data is processed with a great amount of computation, i.e., arithmetic operations. A limited amount of data is provided as input in this processing, and bulk data is there at the outcome. On the other hand, commercial data processing is completely different. In commercial data processing, the outcome is limited compared to the input data. The computational operations are also limited in commercial data processing.  ]
