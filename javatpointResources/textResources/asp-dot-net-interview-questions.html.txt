p => [ A list of top frequently asked ASP.NET interview questions and answers are given below. ]
h3 => [ 1) What is ASP? ]
p => [ ASP stands for Active Server Pages. It is also known as classic ASP. It is a server-side technology provided by Microsoft which is used to create dynamic and user-friendly web pages. It uses different scripting languages to create dynamic web pages which can be run on any browsers.  ]
h3 => [ 2) What is ASP.NET? ]
p => [ ASP.Net is a specification by Microsoft which is used to create web applications and web services. It is a part of ".Net framework". You can create ASP.Net applications in most of the .Net compatible languages like Visual Basic, C#, etc. ASP.Net provides much better performance than scripting languages.  ]
h3 => [ 3) What is the difference between the ASP and ASP.NET? ]
p => [ The main difference between ASP and ASP.Net is that ASP is interpreted, while ASP.Net is compiled. ASP uses VBScript, therefore when the ASP page is executed, it is interpreted. On the other hand, ASP.Net uses .Net languages like C# and VB.NET, which is compiled to Microsoft intermediate language. ]
h3 => [ 4) What is IIS? ]
p => [ IIS stands for Internet Information Services. It is created by Microsoft to provide Internet-based services to ASP.NET Web applications. ]
h3 => [ 5) What is the usage of IIS? ]
p => [ Following are the main usage of IIS: ]
li => [ IIS is used to make your computer to work as a Web server and provides the functionality to develop and deploy Web applications on the server. ]
li => [ IIS handles the request and response cycle on the Web server. ]
li => [ IIS also offers the services of SMTP and FrontPage server extensions. ]

h3 => [ 6) What is a multilingual website? ]
p => [ If a website provides content in many languages, it is known as a multilingual website. It contains multiple copies of its content and other resources, such as date and time, in different languages. ]
h3 => [ 7) What is caching? Explain. ]
p => [ Caching is the technique which facilitates you to store frequently used items in memory so that they can be accessed more quickly. ]
h3 => [ 8) what are the main requirements for caching? ]
li => [ By caching the response, your request is served by the response already stored in memory. ]
li => [ You must be very careful while choosing the items to cache because Caching incurs overhead. ]
li => [ A frequently used web form which data doesn't frequently change is good for caching.  ]
li => [ A cached web form freezes form?s server-side content, and changes to that content do not appear until the cache is refreshed. ]
h3 => [ 9) What are the advantages of ASP.NET? ]
p => [ ASP.Net is the next generation of ASP technology platform. It is superior to ASP in the following ways: ]
li => [ Highly Scalable ]

li => [ Third party control ]
li => [ Configuration and Deployment are easy. ]
li => [ Object and Page caching ]
li => [ Strict coding requirements ]
h3 => [ 10) What is the concept of Postback in ASP.NET? ]

h3 => [ 14) What is the difference between ASP.NET Webforms and ASP.NET MVC? ]
p => [  ASP.NET Webforms uses the  page controller  approach for rendering layout. In this approach, every page has its controller. ]
p => [  On the other hand, ASP.NET MVC uses the  Front Controller  approach. In this approach, there is a common controller for all pages.  ]
h3 => [ 15) What is the difference between the GET method () and POST method ()? ]
th => [ No.  ]
th => [ get method( ) ]
th => [ post method( ) ]

td => [ 6. ]
h3 => [ 16) What is the difference between session object and application object? ]
p => [ The session object is used to maintain the session of each user. A session id is generated if a user enters in the application and when the user leaves the application, the session id is automatically deleted. ]
p => [ On the other hand, the application object is used to store the information and access variables from any page in the application.  ]
h3 => [ 17) What is the difference between trace and debug? ]
p => [ Debug class is used to debug builds. Trace class is used for both debug and release builds. ]
h3 => [ 18) What is the difference between client-side and server-side validations in WebPages? ]
p => [ The client-side validation happens at the client's side with the help of JavaScript and VBScript. This validation has occurred before the Web page is sent to the server. ]
p => [ The server-side validation happens at the server side. ]
h3 => [ 19) What is the difference between file-based dependency and key-based dependency? ]
p => [  File-based dependency:  File-based dependency facilitates you to save the dependency on a file in a disk. ]
p => [  Key-based dependency:  In key-based dependency, you depend on another cached item. ]
h3 => [ 20) What is the difference between globalization and localization? ]
p => [  Globalization:  Globalization is a technique to identify the part of a Web application that is different for different languages and separate it out from the web application. ]
p => [  Localization:  In localization, you try to configure a Web application so that it can be supported for a specific language or locale. ]
h3 => [ 21) What is the difference between a page theme and a global theme? ]
p => [  Page Theme:  The page theme is applied to particular web pages of the project. It is stored inside a subfolder of the App_Themes folder. ]

p => [  Late Binding:  In late binding, a virtual method is called which is decided at runtime. ]
h3 => [ 23) What is the difference between server-side scripting and client-side scripting? ]
p => [  Server-side scripting:  In server-side scripting, all the script are executed by the server and interpreted as needed. ]
