h3 => [ 9) What are the key differences between XHTML and HTML? ]
p => [ HTML and XHTML, both are markup languages. Let's see the key differences between them: ]
th => [ HTML ]
th => [ XHTML ]
td => [ HTML is an acronym that stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the most widely used language over the internet. ]
td => [ XHTML is an acronym that stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language. ]
td => [ HTML is a language used to create web pages and link them from one to another. ]
td => [ XHTML is considered a part of the XML markup language. It contains the features of both XML and HTML. ]
td => [ Tim Berners-Lee developed HTML in 1991. ]
td => [ XHTML was developed by W3C, i.e., World Wide Web Consortium, and was released in 2000. ]
td => [ HTML is extended from SGML and follows the format of document file format. ]
td => [ XHTML is extended from XML and HTML and follows the markup language format. ]
td => [ In HTML, it is not necessary to write Doctype at the top. ]
td => [ In XHTML, you must write Doctype at the top of the file. ]
td => [ HTML is not strictly case-sensitive. It is not necessary to put all tags in lower or upper case. ]
td => [ XHTML is strictly case-sensitive. Here, you have to put every tag and attribute in lower case. ]
td => [ In HTML, it is not necessary to close the tags in the order they are opened. ]
td => [ In XHTML, you must close the tags in the order they are opened. ]
td => [ HTML is an older language for linking web pages on the internet. ]
td => [ In comparison, XHTML is called a better version of HTML. ]
td => [ In HTML, it is not necessary to mention quotes while using attributes. For example: &lt;JavaTpoint&gt;. ]
td => [ In XHTML, it is mandatory to mention quotes while using attributes. For example: &lt;JavaTpoint="JTP"&gt;. ]
td => [ In HTML, filename extensions are used as ".html", and ".htm". ]
td => [ In XHTML, filename extensions are used as ".xhtml", ".xht", ".xml". ]
h3 => [ 10) How are variables different in CoffeeScript than JavaScript? ]
p => [ In JavaScript, we have to add a semi-colon for variables at the end of it to execute the program. On the other hand, in CoffeeScript, it is not necessary to add a semi-colon at the end of the statement. ]
h3 => [ 11) What do you understand by the CSS box model? ]
p => [ The CSS box model is a way to handle CSS layout. This term is used when we talk about the design and layout of th elements. Each element is composed of its content, padding, border, and margin. ]
p => [ In other words, we can say that the CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. ]
h3 => [ 12) What is the difference between Git Pull and Git Fetch commands? ]
p => [ Git pull and Git fetch are the Git commands used to make changes and retrieve data. Let's see the key differences between them: ]
th => [ Git fetch ]
th => [ Git pull ]
td => [ The Git Fetch command downloads only new data from a remote repository. The Git fetch command is more like checking to see if any changes are available. ]
td => [ The Git pull command pulls new data and integrates it with the current working files, updating the current HEAD branch with the latest modifications from the remote server. ]
td => [ The Git fetch command does not include any new information in your working files. ]
td => [ The Git pull command combines remote modifications with those made locally. ]
h3 => [ 13) What do you know about CSS Selectors? ]
p => [ CSS selectors are used to selecting or finding the HTML elements you want to style and make changes in their style. CSS selectors can be divided into the following five categories: ]
strong => [ Simple selectors: ]
strong => [ Combinator selectors: ]
strong => [ Pseudo-class selectors: ]
strong => [ Pseudo-elements selectors: ]
strong => [ Attribute selectors: ]
h3 => [ 14) What is the key difference between Class and Prototype-based inheritance? ]
p => [ The most important difference between class-based and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type that can be instantiated at runtime. On the other hand, a prototype is itself an object instance. In JavaScript, the object system is prototype-based, not class-based. That's why inheritance in JavaScript is different from other programming languages. ]
p => [ Objects are just a collection of name and value pairs in JavaScript. In JavaScript inheritance, there is only one construct, called object. Every object has private property linked to another object known as its prototype. ]
h3 => [ 15) What is the key difference between Null and Undefined in JavaScript? ]
p => [ Many people think that Null and Undefined are the same in JavaScript, but they have many differences. In the following table, we have included the key differences between them: ]
th => [ Null ]
th => [ Undefined ]
td => [ A null is an object with no value. ]
td => [ Undefined is a type. ]
td => [ Null is an intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript. ]
td => [ In Undefined, the value does not exist in the compiler. It is the global object. ]
td => [ typeof null; // "object" ]
td => [ typeof undefined; // "undefined" ]
td => [ null === undefined // false ]
td => [ A variable is defined as null when trying to convey that the variable is empty. ]
td => [ A variable is defined as undefined when we try to convey that the variable does not exist or is not available. ]
h3 => [ 16) What is the difference between Visibility:Hidden;and Display:None;? ]
p => [ The Visibility:Hidden; and Display:None; both are used in front-end development when we don't want to display things on the screen. ]
li => [ Visibility:Hidden; is used when you don't want to show the things in output. It is not visible but contains its original space.  ]
li => [ Display:None; is also used to hide the things on the screen, but it doesn't take any space. ]
h3 => [ 17) What is the importance of HTML DOCTYPE? ]
p => [ In HTML, the DOCTYPE declaration points to a Document Type Definition (DTD). It is used to instruct the web browser about what version of the markup language the page is written. The DOCTYPE declaration is written as the first thing in the HTML document, before the &lt;html&gt; tag. It is a set of markup language rules that makes the browser easily and correctly interpret the content written within. ]
h3 => [ 18) What is the key difference between a host object and a native object? ]
p => [ Host Objects are the objects supplied by a particular environment. On the other hand, the Native Objects are the standard built-in objects provided by JavaScript. ]
h3 => [ 19) What is a marquee in HTML? ]
p => [ In HTML, a marquee is a scrolling piece of text displayed on the webpage. According to the marquee settings, it is either scrolled horizontally across or vertically up or down your web page. The marquee effect is created by using HTML &lt;marquee&gt; tag, which automatically scrolls the text or images up, down, left, or right. ]
h4 => [ Note: The &lt;marquee&gt; tag is now deprecated in HTML5. You can use JavaScript and CSS to create such marquee effects on the new web pages. ]
h3 => [ 20) What is the key difference between cookies, session storage, and local storage? ]
p => [ Difference between cookies, session storage, and local storage ]
strong => [ Cookies: ]
strong => [ Session storage: ]
strong => [ Local storage: ]
h3 => [ 21) What do you understand by Semantic HTML? How does it work? ]
p => [ Semantic HTML is a type of coding that uses HTML markup to reinforce the semantics or meaning of the information in web pages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is processed by traditional web browsers and many other user agents. It is used to emphasize the content's semantics or meaning. ]
p => [ The tags are different in semantic HTML as compared to normal HTML. For example, the &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tag is not used for bold statements in semantic HTML, and the &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; element is for italic. Instead, we use the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tags and &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; tags respectively. ]
h3 => [ 22) What do you understand by Web Accessibility? ]
p => [ Web Accessibility is a way to design, develop, and code websites and web tools that people with disabilities can also use. It makes using the technology easy for certain people who have difficulties hearing or seeing. It ensures that the web is also usable by people with a wide range of disabilities. ]
h3 => [ 23) What is the difference between Git Merge and Git Rebase? ]
p => [ Git merge, and Git rebase are both used to integrate changes from one branch into another. Git rebase moves a feature branch into a master while the Git merge adds a new commit, preserving the history. ]
p => [ According to the official Git manual, the Git Rebase "reapplies commits on top of another base branch". On the other hand, Git merge "joins two or more development histories together". In other words, we can see that the Git merge preserves history as it happened, while the Git rebase rewrites it. ]
p => [ For example, if you are working on a new feature in a dedicated branch, and another team member pushes new commits to the master branch, the Git merge will incorporate new commits into your feature branch. Every time you need to include modifications, you would require an extra merging commit. On the other hand, in Git rebase, you can rebase the feature branch into master instead of merging it. This includes all the new commits in the master branch and rewrites the project history by creating brand new commits for each one in the original branch. ]
h3 => [ 24) What is functional programming in JavaScript? ]
p => [ In JavaScript, functional programming is a programming paradigm mainly designed to handle pure mathematical functions as it focuses on writing more compounded and pure functions. It is used in JavaScript as JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language. In JavaScript, we can easily mix a lot of different paradigms inside a simple piece of JavaScript code. We can use procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming paradigms simultaneously in JavaScript, which makes it more powerful. ]
h3 => [ 25) What do you understand by lazy loading? What are the advantages and disadvantages of lazy loading? ]
p => [ Lazy loading is a design pattern and optimization technique used in computer programming to delay the initialization of an object until a required period. It is also known as on-demand loading. This optimization technique is used for online content like a website or a web app. It is used to enhance the performance of the web page. In this technique, instead of loading the entire web page and rendering it to the user in one go as in bulk loading, only the required section is loaded, and it delays the remaining part of the web page until the user requires it. ]
strong => [ Advantages of Lazy loading ]
li => [ Lazy loading or on-demand loading enhances the performance of web pages by reducing time consumption and memory usage. ]
li => [ It optimizes the content delivery on the web page.  ]
li => [ It loads only a fraction of the web page first, which is required. Thus, the time taken is less, and the loading of the rest of the part of the web page is delayed, which saves storage. ]
li => [ It enhances the user's experience as the requested content is delivered quickly.  ]
li => [ It avoids unnecessary code execution. ]
li => [ It is cost-effective as it practices the optimal time and space resources usage. ]
strong => [ Disadvantages of Lazy loading ]
li => [ The developers have to add some extra lines of code to the existing ones to implement lazy load. It can make the code a bit complicated. ]
li => [ Sometimes, lazy loading may affect the website's ranking on search engines because of improper indexing of the content, which is not loaded. ]
h3 => [ 26) What is the syntax of using a function as a class? ]
p => [ Following is the syntax of using a function as a class:  ]
h3 => [ 27) What is the difference between a tag and an attribute in HTML? ]
p => [ Tags and attributes are two concepts used in HTML. They work together but perform different functions. The main difference between an HTML tag and an HTML attribute is that an HTML tag is a way of representing an HTML element in the program. On the other hand, an HTML attribute describes the characteristics of an HTML element. For example, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;href&gt;, &lt;button&gt;, and &lt;div&gt; etc. are HTML tags and src, class, and id etc. are the example of HTML attributes. ]
strong => [ See this example: ]
p => [ In the above example, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are attributes of the &lt;img&gt; tag. ]
strong => [ Difference between HTML tags and HTML attributes ]
th => [ HTML Tags ]
th => [ HTML Attributes ]
td => [ HTML tags are generally the starting and ending parts of the HTML code. ]
td => [ HTML attributes are used to define the character of the HTML elements. ]
td => [ HTML tags define a way to represent and hold HTML elements in the program. ]
td => [ HTML attributes are generally used to provide additional styling to the element. ]
td => [ HTML tags begin with &lt; symbol and end with &gt; symbol. ]
td => [ HTML attributes are always placed in the opening tag of an element. ]
td => [ HTML tags are like keywords where every single tag has a unique meaning. ]
td => [ HTML attributes provide various additional properties to the existing HTML element. ]
h3 => [ 28) What is CSS float? ]
p => [ CSS float is a property that is used to specify whether an element should float to the left, right, or not at all. It is used when we have to push our web page element left or right and make all other elements cover around it. ]
h3 => [ 29) What is the difference between inline and block elements in HTML? ]
p => [ The HTML inline and block elements are important areas of front-end development. Let us see the differences between the inline and block elements in HTML: ]
p => [  Block Elements:  Block elements are types of blocks that contain many elements in a line itself. They consider top and bottom margins and don't contain any other elements next to them. They consume the full width available and always start in a new line. ]
strong => [ Examples of Block elements: ]
strong => [ &lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;div&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;li&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;ul&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;ol&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;hr&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;p&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;table&gt;: ]
strong => [ HTML 5 Semantic block elements: ]
strong => [ &lt;header&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;nav&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;footer&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;main&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;section&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;article&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;aside&gt;: ]
p => [  Inline Elements:  Inline elements take up only enough width that is sufficient to them and allow other elements next to it inline. They do not have top and bottom margins as block elements have only the left and right and consider the padding. ]
strong => [ Examples of Inline elements: ]
strong => [ &lt;a&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;br&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;script&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;input&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;img&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;span&gt;: ]
strong => [ &lt;b&gt;: ]
