h2 => [ Linux operating system internals ]
h3 => [ 1) What is Linux? Discuss its features. ]
p => [ Linux is a UNIX based operating system. Linus Torvalds first introduced it. It is an open source operating system that was designed to provide free and a low-cost operating system for the computer users. ]
p => [  Linux is an open-source Unix-like computer OS that directly manages the resources and hardware of a system, like storage, memory, and CPU, and handles the communication between hardware and software. First, it was published on 5 October 1991 by  [object Object]  for systems and is considered faster and more secure than Windows. It's freely distributable and is basically established around Linux Kernel. Additionally, it can be installed in notebooks, computers, laptops, mobiles, etc. Linux operating system flavors include Gentoo, SUSE Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, etc. ]

h3 => [ 17) What is Swap Space? ]
p => [ Swap space is used to specify a space which is used by Linux to hold some concurrent running program temporarily. It is used when RAM does not have enough space to hold all programs that are executing. ]
p => [ As its name implies, swap space is a space on the hard disk used when the RAM or physical memory amount is full. It's a replacement for physical memory. Its primary function is to replace disk space for memory when actual RAM doesn't have sufficient space to hold every program that is running, and more space is needed. In other words, it can be used as a RAM extension by Linux. ]
h3 => [ 18) What is BASH? ]
p => [ BASH is a short form of Bourne Again SHell. It was a replacement to the original Bourne shell, written by Steve Bourne. ]
p => [  It is generally a command language interpreter. BASH was written for GNU OS by  [object Object]  and can replace Bourne Shell. It is the same as Bourne Shell but contains some extra features like a command-line amendment that make it more convenient and easier to use. It's the default user shell on almost every Linux installation. Basically, it is a non-compiled and interpreted process that can also execute in the terminal window. Also, it is able to read commands in shell scripts. ]
h3 => [ 19) What is the basic difference between BASH and DOS? ]
li => [ BASH commands are case sensitive while DOS commands are not case sensitive. ]

The use of these graphical icons or elements makes it convenient for the user to collaborate with the system. It's visually intuitive and permits higher productivity. It uses the images and the icons which are clicked by the users to communicate with the system. It is more attractive and user-friendly because of the use of the images and icons. ]
p => [  CLI:  CLI stands for Command Line Interface. It is a command-line program that takes text as input to run the tasks of the OS. It permits users to enter declarative commands to give instructions to the system to perform operations. It needs less memory than other interfaces, and it doesn't need Windows because a low-resolution monitor can also be used. It is an interface that allows users to type declarative commands to instruct the computer to perform operations. ]
