li => [ 5 times ]
li => [ 2 times ]
li => [ 3 times ]
span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  C ]
p => [  Explanation:   ]
p => [  Suppose that Suresh's present age= x 
Then, Manish's present age =3x + x= 4x  
After eight years, Manish's age= (2 + ½ ) times of Suresh's age  
=&gt;	( 4x + 8) = ( 2 + ½ ) ( x + 8) 
=&gt;	4x + 8 = 5/2 ( x + 8) 
=&gt;	8x + 16 = 5x + 40 
=&gt;	3x = 40 ? 16 =24 
=&gt;	x = 24 / 3 = 8 
After further eight years, 
Suresh's age = x + 8+ 8= 8+ 8+ 8= 24 
Manish's age = 4x+ 8+ 8= 4×8+ 8+ 8= 48 
Manish's age/ Suresh's age = 48/24 = 2 ]

span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  B ]
p => [  Explanation:   ]
p => [  Let the period be n years 
Then amount after n years= Rs.(30000+ 4347)= 34347 
P(1+ R/100)^T = 34347 
30000(1+ 7/100)^n = 34347 
30000(107/100)^n = 34347 
(107/100)^n = 34347/30000= 11449/10000= (107/100)^2
