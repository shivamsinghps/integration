h3 => [ 1) Tell Me Something About Yourself. ]
p => [ It is a very basic question that is asked by most of the interviewees at first. But the answer to this question is not so easy because in an interview, you have to present yourself differently from others, and for this, your answer should also be different. You can deal with this problem as: Don't tell about your complete personal or professional history. Only give concise information that shows how you're the perfect candidate for this job opportunity. According to Lily Zhang, a Muse writer and MIT career counselor, the formula of present, past, and future is perfect. Inform a little bit about your current working status and the scope, then information about your backgrounds like professional journey and working experience, and at last, tell about why you want this job and why you should be selected for this job? ]

Your answer should be lovely and interesting so that you can simply stand out from others. For example, if you know about the job from a friend or professional contact, then give the name of that person, and after it tells why you are so much excited to join the company. If you find the opportunity through a business or commercial event or article, then share that. And even if you discovered the role through a random job board, then tell the interviewee about the same. ]
h3 => [ 3) Why Do You Want To Work With Us? ]
p => [ You should be very careful while answering this most general question. Because this question is not related to you but the company. With your reply, you can apply to a whole slew of other companies, or if your response is similar to other applicants, then you are missing a golden chance to shine. Zhang recommends using one of four strategies in this condition. It says to do complete research and figure out the thing that makes the company superior to its competitors. Your response can be related to how you've watched the company's growth and achievements since you first know about it. You should pay special attention to the future scope of the organization and how you can contribute to it? You can also share the reason behind your excitement related to the company's interaction with the employees. But make sure you are specific in your answer. In case if you are unable to find out any reason why you want to work with the company in which you are giving an interview, then it can be a signal for you telling that the job is not the right fit. ]
h3 => [ 4) Why Do You Want This Job? ]
p => [ The companies only prefer that person who is passionate about the vacant job. So you should give the most suitable answer about why you want the job? (And in case if you don't want the job, then you should apply elsewhere). To give the appropriate answer, first, figure out some key factors that make the job a perfect fit for you (Take customer support services, for example. The job will be perfect for a candidate who likes to interact with people constantly and get satisfaction by solving their problems). After it, you ought to tell them why you cherish the company (for illustration, you can you've always been energetic to about education and the company is doing extraordinary works within the segment that's why you need to be a portion of it). ]
h3 => [ 5) Why Should We Select You? ]
p => [  This question seems forward, but you are lucky if this question is asked to you. Because it is one of the best questions to share your  skills  and  abilities  with the interviewer, you ought to create a reply that covers three major focuses: that you just don't center as it were on completing the work but moreover conveying awesome results about; that you simply can effortlessly alter yourself with the group and culture; which you're the way better applicant for the position than other candidates. ]
h3 => [ 6) What Extraordinary Can You Bring To The Company? ]
p => [  The main aim of the interviewer against this question is not just to know about your background. But they need to know merely get it what  issues  and  challenges  the company is facing and how you'll alter yourself within the environment of their company. Go through the job description closely, do proper research in the organization, and be attentive in your early-round interviews to understand all the problems that you will have to solve in the role. After it, your work is to connect all your skills and experiences with the role for which you have applied in the company. This will help the recruiters in knowing how you've done a similar role in other companies also. ]
h3 => [ 7) Tell Me About Your Greatest Strengths. ]
p => [  To answer this question, you should talk about those points which show how perfect you are for that particular job! Your answer should be based on the  quality  of your works instead of the  quantity.  You should not rattle off a list of adjectives. You should figure out one or a few (based on the question) qualities that are necessary for the job for which you're interviewing. You may also use relevant examples for easy understanding.  Telling a story or incident  is more impressive and memorable than generalizations. This question is a perfect fit to show your qualities and represent yourself as a great candidate. So you should not miss this golden opportunity. ]
h3 => [ 8) What Are Your Weaknesses? ]
p => [  The main aim of the interviewer against asking this question is not to reject you but to know your  honesty  and  self-awareness.  If you answer, "I don't have any weakness. I'm perfect." Then it is not an impressive answer as it shows your over-confidence. On the other hand, if you reply, "I can't meet a deadline to save my life." Then it shows how weak you are! So you should be very careful while answering this question. It should be balanced, and something with which you're struggling but you're trying to improve it. For example, maybe you are not strong enough at public speaking, but currently, you are doing volunteer work to interact with people and addressing them by organizing meetings. ]
h3 => [ 9) Which Greatest Thing Have You Achieved In Your Professional Life? ]
p => [  The best way to answer this question is to share a previous record of your achievement without being hesitant. You can use the  STAR  method to give a perfect answer to this question.

Share it with  background context,  for example, "In the last job of junior analyst, I was responsible to manage the invoicing process". After it, you describe the  actions  that you did in your job and, at last, tell the interviewer about the  results  of your work that you achieved. For example, I streamlined the process within a month. It saved the time of our group by 12 person-hour each month and also decreased the number of errors occur on invoices by 30%. ]

Don't be  emotional or aggressive,  and stay calm &amp; professional while sharing the incident. Take your time. ]
h3 => [ 11) Let me know Around a Time You Demonstrated Leadership Aptitudes? ]

Use the  STAR  system to tell your examiner a tale, providing enough detail to paint a picture (but not so much that you just start floating) and spelling out the result after any questions. To put it another way, be clear about why you're telling this story and connect all the dots for the questioner. ]
