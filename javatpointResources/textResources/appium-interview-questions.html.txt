p => [ Following is the list of most frequently asked Appium Interview questions and their best possible answers. ]
h3 => [ 1) What is Appium? Why is it used?  ]
p => [ Appium is an open-source, freely distributed mobile application UI Testing framework or automation mobile testing tool used to test mobile applications. It is developed and supported by Sauce Labs to automate native and hybrid mobile apps. Appium is a cross-platform mobile automation tool. It means you can run the same test on multiple platforms. You can also quickly test multiple devices parallel by using Appium.  ]
h3 => [ 2) What are the crucial features of Appium? ]
p => [ Following is the list of crucial features of Appium: ]
li => [ There is a strong and active community available for Appium. ]
li => [ Appium does not require application source code or library. ]
li => [ It is open-source, freely distributed, and cross-platform support. ]
li => [ Due to its multi-platform support, you can run the same test cases on multiple platforms. ]
li => [ Appium allows the parallel execution of test scripts. ]
li => [ Appium is time-efficient because a small change does not require re-installation of the application. ]

li => [ It supports JSON wire protocol. ]
li => [ It does not require recompilation of App. ]
li => [ Appium has no dependency on mobile devices. ]
h3 => [ 3) What are the similarities between Appium and Selenium Webdriver? ]
p => [ There are a lot of similarities between Appium and Selenium Webdriver testing tools. So, if you already know Selenium Webdriver, you can quickly learn Appium. ]
p => [ Appium doesn't have any dependency on mobile devices OS because its framework converts the Selenium Webdriver commands to UIAutomator, and UIAutomation commands for Android and iOS, respectively, according to the device type rather than the OS type. ]
h3 => [ 4) What are the advantages and disadvantages of Appium?  ]
p => [ Following are the list of advantages and disadvantages of Appium: ]
strong => [ Advantages of Appium ]
li => [ Appium is an open-source tool, which means it is freely available. So, we don't have to pay for installing it. ]
li => [ If you are aware of Selenium Webdriver, you can quickly learn Appium because there are many similarities between them. So, it is easy to install. ]
li => [ It allows the automated testing of hybrid, native, and web applications. ]
li => [ Appium is fully compatible with automation. We don't need to include any additional agents in our App like other testing tools to make it compatible with automation. It tests the same App, which is going to upload to App Store. ]
li => [ Along with the mobile application testing, it would also support desktop application testing for windows. ]
li => [ This is a cross-platform, freely available mobile testing tool. We can test it on multiple platforms (single API for both Android and IOS platforms). ]
strong => [ Disadvantages of Appium ]
p => [ Appium has some great features and advantages, but it has some drawbacks too, which are as follows: ]
li => [ It doesn't provide detailed reports. ]
li => [ It uses the remote web driver for testing, so it is a bit slow. ]
li => [ It is not a limitation, but an overhead that Appium uses UIAutomator for Android supports Android SDK, API 16, or higher. However, Appium supports older APIs, but not directly. It uses another open-source library Selendroid to support older APIs. ]
li => [ In iOS, it supports only one instance (iOS Script) to run on one Mac OS device. It means one test can be executed at a time per Mac. If you want to run your tests on multiple iOS devices simultaneously, you need to arrange the same number of Mac machines. But it would be costly to set various Mac machines. ]
h3 => [ 5) Which types of applications can be tested using Appium? ]
p => [ Appium can test all types of applications, i.e., native, hybrid, and web. Let's see them in detail: ]
p => [  Native Applications:  The native applications are software programs that are developed using a specific software development kit. Native apps are designed for use on a particular device and installed from the App Store, such as Google Play Store or Apple's App Store. These applications can work offline and can also use the device notification system. ]
p => [  Examples of native applications are  Pinterest, Skype, Snapchat, etc. ]
p => [  Web Applications:  Web applications are websites that run on browsers. These applications are developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, unlike Android and iOS apps. They do not require a Software Development Kit (SDK) for developers to work with. Web applications run on web browsers so, they don't need any installation. ]
p => [  Examples of some web applications are  Flipkart, Facebook, Twitter, etc. ]
p => [  Hybrid Applications:  Hybrid applications are a combination of native and web applications. Like native applications, you can download them from the App Store, but actually, they are web applications inside. These applications are developed using web development languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc., which allows them to run on any platform. ]
p => [  Examples of some hybrid applications are  OLA, Instagram, Basecamp, etc. ]
h3 => [ 6) What are the main prerequisites to use Appium? ]
p => [ You must have the following things on your system to use Appium. You must have installed the following software: ]
li => [ Java (JDK) on your system. ]

li => [ Selenium Server JAR ]
li => [ Webdriver Language Binding Library ]
li => [ APPIUM for Windows ]
li => [ APK App Info On Google Play ]
li => [ js ]
h4 => [ Note: The js by default comes with "node.js" and "NPM" whenever you install the Appium server. So, you don't need to install node.js and NPM separately. It is already included in the current version of Appium. ]
h3 => [ 7) Explain the working principle of Appium as how it works on your system. ]
p => [ Appium is an "HTTP Server" written using Node.js platform and drives iOS and Android sessions using Webdriver JSON wire protocol. So, before initializing the Appium Server, you must have preinstalled Node.js on your system. ]
p => [ When we download and install Appium on our system, it installs a server and it on the machine that exposes the REST API. When the clients send the command and connection requests, it executes that command on devices like iOS or Android and replies with the HTTP responses. To execute the requests, it uses a mobile test automation framework to run the app's user interface. ]
p => [  For Example , it uses Apple instruments for iOS, Selendroid for Android API 15 or lesser version, and Google UIAutomator for Android API 16 or higher versions. ]
h4 => [ Note: Appium uses the open-source library Selendroid to support older APIs because UIAutomator only supports API 16 or higher. ]
h3 => [ 8) What do you understand by Appium Inspector? ]
p => [ Appium Inspector is similar to Selenium IDE record and Playback tool. It is also is used for record and playback tasks. It is used to record and play the native application behavior by inspecting DOM and generate the test scripts in any desired language. ]
p => [ Appium Inspector does not support Windows and uses UIAutomator viewer as its option. ]

Emulation and simulation processes are both used in mobile app testing in addition to real devices.  ]
h3 => [ 17) Is a server machine required to run tests on Appium?  ]
p => [ No. There is no need for a server machine to run tests on Appium. Appium provides a 2-tier architecture where a test machine connects to a test server running Appium and automating the whole thing. We can run Appium on the same machine where we run our test.  ]
h3 => [ 18) What is the general structure of mobile application testing frameworks?  ]
p => [ There are mainly three segments used in Mobile Application Testing frameworks: ]
strong => [ Application Package: ]
strong => [ Instrumentation TestRunner: ]
strong => [ Test Package: ]
h3 => [ 19) Is it possible to interact with apps using JavaScript while testing with Appium? ]
p => [ Yes. We can easily interact with Apps while using JavaScript. When we run the commands on Appium, the server sends the script to our app wrapped into an anonymous function to be executed.  ]
h3 => [ 20) What is the full form of iPA, APK, .exe, jad, and prc? ]
