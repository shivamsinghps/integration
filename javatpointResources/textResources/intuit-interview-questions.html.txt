Let the ten's digit be x and unit's digit be y.

span => [ Show Answer ]
p => [  Answer:  B ]
p => [  Solution:   
Since the number is greater than the number collect on reversing the number, so the ten's digit is greater than the unit's digit. 
Let ten's and unit's digits are 2x and x respectively. 
Then, (10 x 2x + x) - (10x + 2x) = 36 
9x = 36 
X=4 
Required difference = (2x + x) - (2x - x) = 2x = 8. ]
