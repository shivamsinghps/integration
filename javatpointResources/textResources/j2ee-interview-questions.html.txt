h3 => [ 15) What is JavaServer Faces (JSF)? ]
p => [ JavaServer Faces is a user interface (UI) designing framework which is used for Java-based web applications. JavaServer Faces provides a set of reusable UI components- a standard for web applications. JSF is based on the MVC design pattern. It automatically saves the form data to the server and populates the form dates when display on the client side. ]
h3 => [ 16) What is an EJB platform? ]

h3 => [ 20) Define Hibernate and HQL? ]
p => [  Hibernate is an object-relational mapping and query service. In hibernate, we can write HQL (Hibernate Query Language) scripts instead of SQL, which saves lots of time and effort. Hibernate provides a more powerful  association, inheritance, polymorphism, composition , and  collections . We can process queries easily into the database using the Java objects. Hibernate also allows us to express queries using Java-based criteria. ]
h3 => [ 21) What are the limitations of Hibernate? ]
p => [ Following are some limitations of hibernate: ]
li => [ Slower execution of queries. ]
li => [ Only HQL support is available for composite keys. ]

li => [ Domain objects can be mapped to the relational database. ]
li => [ JPA support for standard ORM. ]
li => [ Better database connectivity in Hibernate when compared to JDBC. ]
h3 => [ 23) Define ORM and its working in J2EE? ]
p => [ ORM refers to Object-Relational mapping. It is the object in a Java class which is mapped into the tables of a relational database using the metadata that describes the mapping between the objects and database. It transforms the data from one representation to another. ]
h3 => [ 24) What is authorization? ]
p => [ An authorization is a process by which access to a method or resource is determined. It relies on the determination of whether the principal associated with a request through authentication is in a given security role. A security role can be explained as a logical grouping of users defined by the person who assembles the application. A deployer maps the security roles to security identities. Security identities may be principles or groups in the operational environment. ]
h3 => [ 25) Define authorization constraint? ]
p => [ An authorization rule which determines who is permitted to access Web resource collection is known as authorization constraint. ]
h3 => [ 26) How will you explain save() and saveorupdate() methods in hibernate? ]
p => [ The Save() method in hibernate is used to store an object in the database. It creates a new entry if the record doesn't exist. ]
p => [ The Saveorupdate() method in hibernate is used for updating the object using the identifier. If the identifier is unavailable, this method calls save(). If the identifier is available, it will call the update method. ]
h3 => [ 27) How will you explain load() and get() methods? ]
p => [  Load():  If an object is missing in the Cache or database, Load() method will throw an exception. Load() method never returns null. ]
p => [  Get():  If an object is missing in the Cache or database, Get() method returns a null value, not the exception. ]
h3 => [ 28) What is a web container in J2EE? ]
p => [ An interface between a component and the low-level platform with defined functionality that is designed to support the component is defined as the web container in J2EE. ]
h3 => [ 29) What is the concept of connection pooling? ]
p => [ Connection pooling is a simple concept which is popular to reuse existing connections. It means that if object connections are already well-defined and connected, then they can be reused whenever there is a requirement instead of generating a new one. ]
h3 => [ 30) What do you understand by the servlet? ]
p => [  Servlet is a server-side component which provides full functionalities to create a server-side program. There are different servlets available with a specific design for a variety of protocols. The most popular type of protocol for the servlet is  HTTP.Servlets , which use the classes in the java packages  javax.servlet, javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest, javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse, javax.servlet.http.HttpSession ;. All servlets must include the Servlet interface, which defines life-cycle methods. ]
h3 => [ 31) Give some advantages of ORM (object-relational mapping)? ]
strong => [ Productivity ]
p => [ The automatic code is generated to reduce the overall data access time based on the data model defined. ]
strong => [ Performance ]
p => [ The complete requirements of an application are managed by the automated code generated by the ORM, which means that there is no need for any extra code, and the overall data access process is made faster and optimized. ]
strong => [ Vendor Independent ]
li => [ The generated code is independent of the vendor, which increases the overall portability of an application. ]
strong => [ Maintainability ]
p => [ The code is well tested and generated by the ORM, and only a developer can understand the code perfectly. ]

li => [ MVC module ]
h3 => [ 42) What is action mapping? ]
p => [ In action mapping, a user specifies action class for a particular URL, i.e., path and different target view, which means, forwards on to which request-response is forwarded. The ActionMapping defines the information that the ActionServlet knows about the mapping of a particular request to an instance of a specific Action class. The mapping is transferred to the execute() method of the Action class, enabling access to this information directly. ]
h3 => [ 43) What do you understand by ActionForm? ]
p => [  ActionForm is a Java bean which may associate one or more ActionMappings. A java bean changes to FormBean when a user extends a class  org.apache.struts.action.ActionForm . ActionForm object is generally populated on the server side automatically, and the client enters data from UI. ActionForm manages the session state for a web application. ]
h3 => [ 44) What is backing bean? ]
p => [ A backing bean is a JavaBeans component which corresponds to JavaServer Pages that includes JavaServer Faces components. The backing bean describes the properties for the components on the page and methods which perform processing for the component. ]
p => [  This processing may include  event handling, validation , and  processing associated with navigation . ]
h3 => [ 45) What is the build file? ]
p => [ A build file is an XML file that consists of one or more asant targets. A target is a set of tasks that a user wants to get executed. When starting asant, a user can select which target is to be executed. If there is no target, then the default target of the project is executed. ]
h3 => [ 46) What do you understand by business logic? ]
p => [ Business logic is the code that includes the functionality of an application. In the EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans) architecture, this logic is implemented by the methods of an enterprise bean. ]
h3 => [ 47) How will you explain CDATA? ]
p => [ A CDATA is a predefined XML tag for the character data, which means "don't interpret these characters," it is similar to parsed character data (PCDATA), in which the standard rules of XML syntax apply. CDATA sections are used to show examples of XML syntax. ]
h3 => [ 48) What do you mean by the Component Contract? ]
p => [ The contract between the J2EE component and its container is known as the component contract. This type of contract includes: ]
li => [ Life-cycle management of the component ]
li => [ An interface which is used by instance to obtain various information and services from its container ]
li => [ List of services that every container must provide for its components. ]
h3 => [ 49) What do you understand by Connector? Explain Connector Architecture. ]
p => [ A connector is a standard extension mechanism for containers, which provides connectivity to enterprise information systems. It is specific to an enterprise information system and contains a resource adapter and application development tools for enterprise information system connectivity. The resource adapter is plugged into a container through its support for system-level contracts, defined in the Connector architecture. ]
p => [ An architecture for the integration of J2EE products with enterprise information systems is known as the connector architecture. A connector architecture consists of:  ]
li => [ A resource adapter which is given by an enterprise information system vendor ]
li => [ A J2EE product that allows this resource adapter to plug in. ]
p => [ Connector architecture also defines a set of contracts which a resource adapter must support to plug into a J2EE product (e.g., transactions, security, and resource management). ]
