h1 => [ Most Asked System Design Interview Questions ]
p => [ Following is a list of most frequently asked System Design interview questions and their best possible answers. ]
h3 => [ 1) What is System Design?/ What do you understand by System Design? ]
p => [ System design is the process of defining elements of a system such as modules, architecture, components, interfaces, and data for a system according to some specified requirements. In this process, the companies define, develop, and design systems that satisfy a business or an organization's specific needs and requirements.  ]
h3 => [ 2) What types of questions are asked in System Design Interview? ]
p => [ In a system design interview, the candidates are asked many questions from the part of a system such as modules, architecture, components, interfaces, communication, data storage, chat services, etc., as well as the real-life problems that a company might be facing. After that, the candidates are categorized according to their field of expertization, such as programmers, designers, developers, and software engineers. ]
h3 => [ 3) What are the essential skills of system designers? / What skills are needed to be a designer? ]
p => [ The System Designers must have the following qualities: ]
li => [ They must be able to understand and solve complex problems. ]
li => [ They have a logical and analytical approach to solve problems and customer's requirements. ]
li => [ They must have good communication skills. ]
li => [ They must be able to work independently as well as part of a team. ]
li => [ They must have a good knowledge of IT and the ability to apply it in their project. ]
li => [ A system designer should be capable of directing the work of others. ]
h3 => [ 4) What is Pastebin? What are the benefits of designing such a system as Pastebin? ]
p => [ Pastebin is a website that allows us to paste text or code to it. The biggest advantage of designing such a system is that we can share a link to that code or text (which we have earlier paste here) anywhere we want. It is not an online code editor, but we can use this system or website as a tool to store any text or code.  ]
h3 => [ 5) As a system designer, can you design universal file sharing and storage apps like Google Drive or Dropbox? ]
p => [ Both apps Google Drive and Dropbox, are used to store and share files, photos, and other media services. We can design things that will allow users to upload/search/view files or photos etc. It will check permissions for file sharing and enables multiple users to make changes in the same document. ]
p => [ By asking this question, the interviewers are interested in knowing how you would handle the following things: ]
li => [ How would users be able to upload/view/search/share files or photos? ]
li => [ How would you track permissions for file sharing? ]
li => [ How would you allow multiple users to edit the same document? ]
h3 => [ 6) How can you design the websites or apps like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram (the social media services which handle hundreds of millions of users)?  ]
p => [ The interviewers ask this question to see how you can deal with a huge quantity of users because it will require many storage systems and other complications. When we design social media services that have to handle millions or billions of users, we must focus on the following components: ]
li => [ Huge and efficient storage and search for posts or tweets. ]
li => [ Newsfeed generation and maintenance ]
li => [ Social Graph (who befriends whom or who follows whom,?especially when millions of users are following a celebrity) ]
p => [ Many times, interviewers spend the whole interview discussing the design and your creative idea of the newsfeed. ]
h3 => [ 7) How can you design a social network and message board service like Quora or Reddit, or HackerNews? ]
p => [ The websites like Quora or Reddit, or HackerNews facilitate users to post questions or share links, and other users can answer these questions or comment on the shared links. The interviewer asks this question to check that if you can provide the following services in your application: ]
li => [ Maintain and record the stats for each answer, e.g., the total number of views, upvotes/downvotes, etc. ]

li => [ The users' timeline must consist of the top questions from all the users and topics they follow (similar to newsfeed generation). ]
h3 => [ 8) What is the use of traffic control software? How can you design such an app? ]
p => [ The traffic control software is used to make traffic control easy, hassle-free, and automatic. To design traffic control software, we must know how to transition from one state to other works. For example, how the signal goes red to green and from green to orange to red.  ]
h3 => [ 9) How can you design a global video streaming service or website/application like YouTube, Netflix or Twitch, etc.? ]
p => [ The interviewer asks this question to check how you can handle such a huge database and provide the user an uninterrupted stream over the internet. Video streaming services or websites/applications such as YouTube, Netflix, or Twitch store and transmit hundreds of petabytes of video data. They also store statistics such as views, likes, number of views, etc.) and allow users to post comments. So the solution you are going to provide must be scalable to support millions of concurrent users. ]

Crawlers are programmed in a way that they can do repetitive actions and make the browsing automated. Every search engine uses crawlers most frequently to browse the InternetInternet and build an index. Crawlers are also called spiders or search engine bots. ]
p => [ The main purpose of crawlers is to index websites worldwide to make them available for every search engine result. ]
h3 => [ 16) How would you design a Web Crawler?  ]
p => [ The Web crawler is a search engine-related service used to index the content of websites over the Internet to make them available for every search engine result.

li => [ You have to handle soft and hard throttling very well. ]
h3 => [ 18) What is the role of a search engine? How would you design a search engine like Google, Bing, or Baidu? ]
p => [ A search engine is a program or a software system designed to carry out web searches which mean to search the World Wide Web in a systematic way for particular information specified in a textual web search query. When we search for something on the search engines, the results are generally presented in a line of results. These search results are referred to as search engine results pages (SERP). A customized search engine can be used within an organization's specific department to locate an item or important employee information systematically. The interviewer asks this question to check if you can make such designs to fulfill the company's needs. You can detail some of the overall architecture and explain it using the foundation below. You can also consider discussing any other relevant issues such as website front-end performance, testing search engine improvements, and integrating previous search data and trends in indexing. ]
h3 => [ 19) How can you design an ATM system?  ]

li => [ An algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time. ]
li => [ An algorithm should be in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. ]
li => [ An algorithm starts with an initial state, and after some instructions to describe a computation, it proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing output. ]
li => [ The output is the last and is terminated at a final ending state. ]
li => [ In an algorithm, the transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input. ]
h3 => [ 26) What is the top-down approach in system analysis and design? ]

li => [ Detail study of the existing system. ]
li => [ Documentation of the existing system. ]
h3 => [ 30) What is the autocomplete functionality, and how can you design this?  ]
p => [ Autocomplete is a feature used to predict the upcoming words or rest of a word a user is typing. The autocomplete feature is used to speed up human-computer interactions. It correctly predicts the word a user intends to enter after only a few characters have been typed into a text input field. It is also called the word completion feature. ]
