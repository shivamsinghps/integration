h1 => [ Control System Interview Questions ]
p => [  A list of top frequently asked  Control System  interview questions and answers are given below. ]
h3 => [ 1) What is meant by System? ]
p => [  When the number of elements connected performs a specific function then the group of elements is said to constitute a system or interconnection of various components for a specific task is called system.  Example:  Automobile.  ]
h3 => [ 2) What is meant by Control System? ]
p => [ Any set of mechanical or electronic devices that manages, regulates or commands the behavior of the system using control loop is called the Control System. It can range from a small controlling device to a large industrial controlling device which is used for controlling processes or machines. ]
a => [ more details.. ]
h3 => [ 3) What are the types of control system? ]
p => [ There are two types of Control System- ]
li => [ Open loop control system. ]
li => [ Closed loop control system. ]
h3 => [ 4) What is open loop and control loop systems? ]
p => [  Open loop control System:  An open-loop control system is a system in which the control action is independent of the desired output signal.  Examples:  Automatic washing machine, Immersion rod. ]
p => [  Closed loop control System:  A closed-loop control system is a system in which control action is dependent on the desired output.  Examples:  Automatic electric iron, Servo voltage stabilizer, an air conditioner. ]

h3 => [ 5) What is time-invariant System? ]
p => [  The time required to change from one state to another state is known as  transient time , the value of current and voltage during this period is called  transient response  and the system in which the input and output characteristics of the system does not change with time is called the  Time-Invariant  System. ]
h3 => [ 6) What are linear and non-linear systems? ]
p => [  Linear system:  Linear systems are the systems which possess the property of homogeneity and superposition. The term superposition means that an input r 1 (t) gives an output c 1 (t) and r 2 (t) will give the output c 2 (t). If we apply both the input r 1 (t) and r 2 (t) together, then the output will be the sum of c 1 (t) and c 2 (t). ]
p => [  Non-Linear System:  Non-linear systems are the systems which do not possess the property of superposition and homogeneity, and the output of these systems are not directly proportional to its input. In these types of systems, the stability of the system depends upon the input and initial state of the system. ]
