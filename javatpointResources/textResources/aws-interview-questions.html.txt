p => [  A list of top frequently asked  AWS Interview Questions  and answers are given below. ]
h3 => [ 1) What is AWS? ]
p => [ AWS stands for Amazon Web Services. It is a service which is provided by the Amazon that uses distributed IT infrastructure to provide different IT resources on demand. It provides different services such as an infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service. ]

h3 => [ 3) What are Key-pairs? ]
p => [ An Amazon EC2 uses public key cryptography which is used to encrypt and decrypt the login information. In public key cryptography, the public key is used to encrypt the information while at the receiver's side, a private key is used to decrypt the information. The combination of a public key and the private key is known as key-pairs. Key-pairs allows you to access the instances securely. ]

p => [ There are four pricing models for EC2 instances: ]
strong => [ On-Demand instance ]
li => [ On-Demand pricing is also known as pay-as-you-go. Pay-as-you-go is a pricing model that allows you to pay only for those resources that you use.  ]
li => [ You need to pay for the compute capacity by per hour or per second that depends on which instances you run. ]
li => [ On-Demand instance does not require any upfront payments. ]
li => [ While using On-Demand instance, you can increase or decrease the compute capacity based on the requirements of your application. ]
li => [ On-Demand instances are recommended for those applications which are of short term and unpredictable workloads. ]
li => [ Users that want low cost and flexibility on EC2 instances with no upfront payments. ]
li => [ On-Demand instances are used for those applications which have been developed or tested on EC2 for the first time. ]
strong => [ Reserved instance ]
li => [ Reserved instance is the second most important pricing model that reduces the overall cost of your AWS environment by making an upfront payment for those services that you know will be used in the future. ]
li => [ Reserved instances provide a discount of up to 75% as compared to On-Demand instance. ]
li => [ Reserved instances are assigned to a specific Availability zone that reserves the compute capacity for you so that you can use whenever you need. ]
li => [ Reserved instances are mainly recommended for those applications that have steady state and require reserve capacity. ]
li => [ Customers who want to use the EC2 over 1 to 3 term can use the reserved instance to reduce the overall computing costs. ]
strong => [ Spot instance ]
li => [ Spot instances consist of unused capacity which is available at a highly discounted rate. ]
li => [ It offers up to 90% discount as compared to On-Demand instance. ]
li => [ Spot instances are mainly recommended for those applications which have flexible start and end times. ]
li => [ It is useful when applications require computing capacity at a very low price.  ]
li => [ It is useful when applications require additional amount of computing capacity at an urgent need. ]

p => [  EIP ( Elastic IP address ) is a service provided by an EC2 instance. It is basically a static IP address attached to an EC2 instance. This address is associated with your AWS account not with an EC2 instance. You can also disassociate your EIP address from your EC2 instance and map it to another EC2 instance in your AWS account. ]
strong => [ Let's understand the concept of EIP through an example: ]
p => [  Suppose we consider the website  www.javatpoint.com  points to the instance which has a public IP address. When instance is restarted, then AWS takes another public IP address from the pool and the previous public IP address is no longer valid. Due to this reason, the original link is no longer available between the website and EC2 instance. To overcome from such situation, Elastic IP address or static address is used which does not change. ]
h3 => [ 18) What are the different storage classes in S3? ]
p => [ Storage classes are used to assist the concurrent loss of data in one or two facilities. Each object in S3 is associated with some storage class. Amazon S3 contains some storage classes in which you can store your objects. You can choose a storage class based on your requirements and these storage classes offer high durability.

h3 => [ 24) Difference between Stopping and Terminating the instances? ]
p => [  Stopping:  You can stop an EC2 instance and stopping an instance means shutting down the instance. Its corresponding EBS volume is still attached to an EC2 instance, so you can restart the instance as well. ]
p => [  Terminating:  You can also terminate the EC2 instance and terminating an instance means you are removing the instance from your AWS account. When you terminate an instance, then its corresponding EBS is also removed. Due to this reason, you cannot restart the EC2 instance. ]
h3 => [ 25) How many Elastic IPs can you create? ]
p => [ 5 elastic IP addresses that you can create per AWS account per region. ]
h3 => [ 26) What is a Load Balancer? ]

li => [ If the virtual machine's hard drive fails, then you can lose your data. ]
strong => [ instance-store ]
li => [ You will be charged from the moment when your instance is started until your instance is terminated. ]
strong => [ EBS backed ]
li => [ An "EBS backed" instance is an EC2 instance that uses EBS volume as a root device  ]
li => [ EBS volumes are not tied to a virtual hardware, but they are restricted to an availability zone. This means that EBS volume is moved from one machine to another machine within the same availability zone. ]
li => [ If the virtual machine's fails, then the virtual machine can be moved to another virtual machine. ]
li => [ The main advantage of "EBS backed" over "instance store-backed" instances is that it can be stopped. When an instance is in a stopped state, then EBS volume can be stored for a later use. The virtual machine is used for some other instance. In stopped state, you are not charged for the EBS storage. ]

strong => [ Master node ]
strong => [ Core node ]
strong => [ Task node ]
h3 => [ 46) How to connect EBS volume to multiple instances? ]
p => [ You cannot connect the EBS volume to multiple instances. But, you can connect multiple EBS volumes to a single instance. ]
h3 => [ 47) What is the use of lifecycle hooks in Autoscaling? ]
p => [ Lifecycle hooks perform custom actions by pausing instances when Autoscaling group launches or terminates an instance. When instance is paused, an instance moves in a wait state. By default, an instance remains in a wait state for 1 hour. For example, when you launch a new instance, lifecycle hooks pauses an instance. When you pause an instance, you can install a software on it or make sure that an instance is completely ready to receive the traffic. ]
