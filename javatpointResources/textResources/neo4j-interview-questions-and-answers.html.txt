td => [ It provides the capability of deep search into the database without affecting the performance along with efficient timing. ]
td => [ It takes longer time for database search and also inconvenient compared to Neo4J. ]
td => [ In Neo4j, two or more objects can be related by making relationship between them. ]
td => [ It lacks relationship and very difficult to use them for connected graphs and data. ]
h3 => [ 13) What is CQL? How to execute CQL commands in Neo4J? ]
p => [ CQL stands for Cypher Query Language. The "$" prompt is used to execute all CQL commands in Neo4j. ]
h3 => [ 14) What is object Cache in Neo4J? ]
p => [ In Neo4J, object cache is used to store individual nodes, their relationships and their properties in a form which is optimized for fast traversal of the graph. Reading from object cache is 5 to 10 times faster than reading from the file buffer cache. ]
h3 => [ 15) Which query language is used by Neo4J? ]
p => [ Cypher Query Language (CQL) is used by Neo4J.  ]
h3 => [ 16) How can you delete databases in Neo4J? ]
p => [ Delete commands in Neo4J:  ]
strong => [ Delete a single node: ]
strong => [ Delete all nodes and relationships: ]
strong => [ Delete a node with its relationship: ]
strong => [ Delete relationships only:  ]
h3 => [ 17) Is it possible to query Neo4j over the internet? ]
