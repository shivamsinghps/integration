h3 => [ 5) What is the difference between .twb and .twbx extension? ]
th => [ .twb ]
th => [ .twbx ]
td => [ A .twb is an xml document that contains the information about your dashboards, sheets, and stories. ]

td => [ A .twbx is a package of files "compressed" together. ]
td => [ It includes data source file and any other file used to produce the workbook, including images. ]
h3 => [ 6) What is the difference between traditional BI tools and Tableau? ]
th => [ Traditional BI tools ]
th => [ Tableau ]
td => [ Traditional BI architecture has hardware limitations. ]

td => [ It has a predefined view of data. ]
td => [ It uses predictive analysis for various business operations.  ]
h3 => [ 7) What are the different data types in Tableau? ]
p => [ Tableau expresses fields and assigns data types automatically. If the data source appoints the data type, Tableau will use that data type. If the data source doesn't individually assign a data type, Tableau will assign one. Tableau consist of the following data types: ]
li => [ Date values ]
li => [ Text values ]
li => [ Numerical values ]
li => [ Date and time values ]
li => [ Boolean values (True or False conditions) ]

h3 => [ 8) What are the different types of joins in Tableau? ]
p => [ The joins in Tableau are the same as SQL joins. There are five main joins, such as: ]
p => [  1)  Cross Joins:  Cross join produces rows which combine each row from the first table with each row from the second table. ]
p => [  2)  Inner Joins:  An inner join returns the matching rows from the tables that are being merged.  ]
p => [  3)  Left Outer Join:  The left outer join returns matching rows from the tables being joined, and also non-matching rows from the left table in the result and places  NULL  values in the attributes that come from the right table. ]
p => [  4)  Right Outer Join:  The right outer join operation returns matching rows from the tables being merged, and also non-matching rows from the right table as the result and places  NULL  values in the attributes that come from the left table. ]
p => [  4)  Full Outer Join:  The full outer join is used to combine tables. As a result, it contains all values from both tables. ]
h3 => [ 9) How many tables you can join in Tableau? ]
p => [ In Tableau, you can join an atmost 32 tables.  ]
h3 => [ 10) Explain the different connections you can make with your datasets? ]
p => [ We can connect the datasets in two ways, such as: ]
p => [ 
 ]
strong => [ Live: ]
strong => [ Extract: ]
h3 => [ 11) What are Shelves? ]
p => [ Shelves are the named areas placed on the left and top of the view in the worksheet. You can build a view by drag and drop fields onto the shelves. Some shelves are available when you select a specific mark type. ]
h3 => [ 12) What are the Sets? ]
p => [ In Tableau, sets are used to create subsets of data based on the specific condition defined by the user. Sets are only created based on the dimension field. ]
p => [ There are two types of sets in Tableau, such as: ]
strong => [ Dynamic Sets: ]
strong => [ Fixed Sets: ]
h3 => [ 13) What are Groups? ]
p => [ A group is a combination of the members of the dimension which make higher-level categories. ]
h3 => [ 14) What is the Hierarchical Field? ]
p => [ In Tableau a hierarchical field is used for drilling down data. It means viewing your data at a more granular level. ]
h3 => [ 15) What is a Tableau Data Server? ]
p => [ Tableau server acts as a middle man between the data and Tableau uses. Tableau Data Server allows you to share and upload data extracts, preserve database connections, as well as reuse calculations and field metadata.  ]
p => [ This means any changes you can make for the calculated field, data-set, aliases, definitions or parameters, can be saved and shared with others, that allows for a secure, centrally managed and standardized dataset as well as you can leverage your server's resources to run queries on extracts without having first to transfer them to your local machine.  ]
h3 => [ 16) What is the Tableau Data Engine? ]
p => [ Tableau Data Engine is a cool feature in Tableau. It?s an analytical database that designed to achieve instant query response, predictive performance, integrate seamlessly into existing data infrastructure, and it is not limited to load entire data sets into the memory. ]
p => [ If you are work with a large amount of data, it does take some time to create indexes, import, and sort data, but after that everything speeds up. Tableau Data Engine is not in-memory technology. The data is stored in disk after its import, and the RAM is hardly utilized. ]
h3 => [ 17) How to create a Calculated Field in Tableau? ]
li => [ Click on the drop-down option to the right of dimension on the data pane and go to the create options and select the calculated field to open the calculation editor. ]
li => [ Name the calculated field and create a formula. ]
h3 => [ 18) Define Dual axis. ]
p => [ The dual-axis is used to visualize two different measures in two different chart types. A date column and two measures are necessary to build a dual-axis chart.  ]
p => [ The different scales are used in the graph that helps the user to understand both measures.  ]
h3 => [ 19) What is the difference between the Tree map and Heat map? ]

h3 => [ 22) What is the Story in Tableau? ]
p => [ A story is a sheet which contains a sequence of dashboards or worksheets that work together to deliver information.  ]

h3 => [ 27) Can we place an excel file in a shared location in Tableau? ]
p => [ Yes, we can place an excel file in a shared location, but for better performance, we should use extract. ]
h3 => [ 28) Suppose license expires today, will users be able to view dashboard or worksheet which published on the server? ]
p => [ If Tableau Desktop license expires today, then you cannot access the dashboard or worksheet because the username on the server will have to unroll unlicensed. ]
p => [ But others can access because the site admin can change the ownership to another person, so the extracts do not fail. ]
h3 => [ 29) What are the different Tableau files? ]
strong => [ Bookmarks: ]
strong => [ Workbooks: ]
strong => [ Packaged workbooks: ]
strong => [ Data extraction files: ]
strong => [ Data connection files: ]
