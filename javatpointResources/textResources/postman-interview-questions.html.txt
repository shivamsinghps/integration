h3 => [ 10) What is an HTTP request? Give an example of an HTTP request. ]
p => [ An HTTP request is a programming request made by the client to a named host located on a server. HTTP works as a communication interface or a request-response protocol between a client and server. The main aim of the HTTP request is to access a resource on the server. To make the HTTP request, the client uses components of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which includes the information needed to access the resource. ]
strong => [ An example of the HTTP request: ]
p => [ A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then, the server responds to the client. The response sent by the server contains the status information about the request, and it can also contain the requested content. ]

h3 => [ 12) Why does Postman accept Base64 encoding only? ]
p => [ Postman accepts Base64 encoding only because it transmits the data into the textual form and sends it in an easier form, such as HTML form data. This is also preferred because we can rely on the same 64 characters in any encoding language we want to use. ]
h3 => [ 13) Which type of encoding does Postman accept authorization credentials and why? ]
p => [ Postman accepts authorization credentials in Base64 encoding only. This is inbuilt in Postman, or else you can refer to a third-party website to convert the credentials in base64. The Base64 authorization credentials are generally used because they transmit the data into a textual form and send it in an easier form, such as HTML form data. ]
h3 => [ 14) What are the core components of an HTTP Response? ]
p => [ Following are the four core components of an HTTP Response: ]
li => [ Status/Response Code: The server generates the status or response codes when the client makes a request. For example, 404 means Page Not Found, and 200 means Response is OK. ]
li => [ HTTP Version: It describes the HTTP version. For example: HTTP v1.1, HTTP v1.3 etc. ]
li => [ Response Header: The Response Header includes the information for the HTTP response message. For example, Content-type, Content-length, date, status, and server type. ]
li => [ Response Body: The Response Body contains the client's data requested from the server. ]
h3 => [ 15) What is the meaning of the term environment in Postman? ]
p => [ In Postman, the term environment is a set of key-value pairs. You can create multiple environments in Postman and switch among them quickly by pressing a button. There are 2 types of environment, global and local. ]
h3 => [ 16) Can we have two global scope variables with the same name in Postman? ]
p => [ The global variables are global, so we cannot set duplicate names for them without any environment as it creates confusion for the software. On the other hand, local variables can have the same name but in different environments. ]
h3 => [ 17) Which one is preferred in Postman, a global or local variable? ]
p => [ In Postman, if 2 variables have the same name (one being local, the other global), then the higher priority is of the local variable. The local variable will overwrite the global variable. ]
h3 => [ 18) How can you log variable values in Postman? ]
p => [ In Postman, we can log the variable values in the console by using the following command: ]
h3 => [ 19) What is the use of Postman monitor? ]
p => [ The Postman monitor is used for running collections. Collections run till the specified time defined by the users. It requires the users to be logged in, and the users share the Monitor reports over an email on a daily or monthly basis. ]
h3 => [ 20) What do you understand by team workspace in Postman? ]
p => [ As we know, a workspace is a collaborative environment for users to develop and test APIs. In the same way, a team workspace is a workspace that is shared by the whole team working on the same collections of requests. Usually, it is time-consuming and hard to share the collections through external drives or other sharing; the team workspace synchronizes and collaborates all the team's work in one place. ]
h3 => [ 21) What is the difference between Query Params and Path Variables? ]
p => [ Query Params or Query Parameters are used for sorting or filtering the resources. On the other hand, Path Variables are used for identifying specific resources. ]
h3 => [ 22) What is the use of Postman Collection runners? ]
p => [ The Postman Collection runner is used to perform Data-driven testing. It runs a group of API requests for multiple iterations with different data sets. ]
h3 => [ 23) What is Basic Auth in Postman? ]
p => [ In Postman, Basic Auth is an authorization technique provided for HTTP user agents like web browsers to enter username and password. After entering the username and password, it gets associated with the request. ]
h3 => [ 24) Can we import local variables in Postman Monitors? ]
p => [ Yes, we can import local variables in Postman Monitors, but it is not allowed to import global variables in Postman Monitors. ]
h3 => [ 25) What are the main limitations of Postman? ]
p => [ Following is the list of key limitations of Postman: ]
li => [ Postman cannot process 1000+ API requests. ]
li => [ In the case of huge projects, it isn't easy to manage the collections and requests. ]
li => [ Postman is not suitable for managing the workspace in the form of code. This is because there would be a lot of code duplication for dynamic API requests. ]
h3 => [ 26) What is a binary form in POST methods? What is its usage? ]
p => [ In POST methods, the binary form is designed to send data easily in a format it is impossible to enter data manually. This is mainly used when sending large files like images, CSV files, etc., in the POST request. The binary representation is one of the easiest representations used for sending complex data with the request. ]
h3 => [ 27) What is the use of Postman cloud when we are working in a company? ]
p => [ The Postman cloud is a common repository of companies to access Postman collections. That is why we use it when we are working in a company. We can save the work instantly in the Postman cloud after logging in. It facilitates the team members to access data/collections from anywhere. ]
h3 => [ 28) What is digest auth in Postman? ]
p => [ The digest auth or digest authorization is one of the authorization techniques provided by Postman. This technique lets the clients send the request first to the API and get responses from the server, including a number that can be used only once a real value and 401 unauthorized responses. After that, the client can send back an encrypted data array with both username and password and the data received from the server earlier. Now, the server uses this data to generate an encrypted data string and compares this with what was sent for authenticating the request. ]
h3 => [ 29) Why is it not suggested to save work in Postman cloud? ]
p => [ It is not suggested and is not preferred to save your work in the Postman cloud as the company's work is not allowed to be leaked and remain confidential. While saving your work on Postman cloud, it may cause a security breach as it requires sign-in. That's why the Postman Cloud is not suggested for saving work, and team workspace is highly preferred. ]
h3 => [ 30) What do you understand by status code 201? ]
p => [ The status code 201 means created when you have successfully created a resource using POST or PUT request. It returns a link to a newly created resource using the location header. ]
h3 => [ 31) What is the procedure to remove local variables? ]
p => [ The local variables are automatically removed once you have executed and completed the tests. ]
h3 => [ 32) What is the procedure to save the responses of API to a file in Postman? ]
p => [ In Postman, there are two ways to save the responses of an API to a file: ]
li => [ First, click on the download button in the response section. ]
li => [ Second, click on the arrow next to the send button. Here, you will see an option to send and download. After clicking on it, you will get a prompt Postman asking for the location of saving the response post successful request execution. ]
h3 => [ 33) What is the meaning of the status code 304? ]
p => [ The status code 304 means NOT MODIFIED. It is used to minimize the network bandwidth usage in conditional GET requests. The response body should be empty. Headers should have a date, and location, etc. ]
h3 => [ 34) What is the use of the 301 status code in Postman? ]
p => [ In Postman, the 301 status code is used to specify that the page has been permanently redirected from one website page to another. It tells the search engine that the old page is outdated, and the search engine has to index the new page URL. ]

p => [ The key difference between the form data and x-www-form-urlencoded is that the URL will be prearranged when sent through x-www-form-urlencoded. ]
h3 => [ 38) In which conditions should we use global, collection, and local variables? ]
p => [ Global variables are the general-purpose variables. They are used while passing data to other requests and are ideal for quick results and prototyping. ]
p => [ Collection variables are generally used for storing some constants that do not change during the execution of the collection. These variables are used for constants that do not change during the execution and URLs / authentication credentials if only one environment exists. ]
p => [ Local variables are the temporary variables and are only available within the request that has set them or when using Newman/Collection runner during the script execution. These variables are used whenever we have to override all other variable scopes. ]
h3 => [ 39) How can we access the history of requests in Postman? ]
p => [ In Postman, we can access the history of requests in the History tab provided on the Postman application. When we sign into the Postman account, the history will be synced across the devices where you are logged in. After clicking on any of the requests present in the History tab, the view will open the request that we saved while working on it earlier. History also contains the collection runs that were executed as summarized versions. ]
p => [ When you click on the "View More option" on the request, you will see options to save, document, monitor, delete or mock the request. You can also select multiple requests by using Command or Control button and then clicking on the request. ]
