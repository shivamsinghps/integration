p => [  A list of most frequently asked  Selenium interview questions , and their answers are given below. ]
h3 => [ Basic Level - Selenium Interview Questions ]
h3 => [ 1) What is test automation or automation testing?  ]
p => [ Automation testing uses automation tools to write and execute test cases, no manual involvement is necessary for executing an automated test suite. Testers prefer automation tools to write test scripts and test cases and then group into test suites. ]
p => [ Automation testing enables the use of specialized tools to automate the execution of manually designed test cases without any human intervention. Automation testing tools can access the test data, controls the execution of tests and compares the actual result against the expected result. Consequently, generating detailed test reports of the system under test. ]

h3 => [ 16) Explain the difference between assert and verify commands? ]
p => [  Assert : Assert command checks if the given condition is true or false. If the condition is true, the program control will execute the next phase of testing, and if the condition is false, execution will stop, and nothing will be executed. ]
p => [  Verify : Verify command also checks if the given condition is true or false. It doesn't halt program execution, i.e., any failure during verification would not stop the execution, and all the test phases would be executed. ]
h3 => [ 17) What do you mean by XPath?  ]
p => [ XPath is also defined as XML Path. It is a language used to query XML documents. It is an important approach to locate elements in Selenium. XPath consists of a path expression along with some conditions. Here, we can easily write XPath script/query to locate any element in the webpage. It is developed to allow the navigation of XML documents. The key factors that it considered while navigating are selecting individual elements, attributes, or some other part of an XML document for specific processing. It also produces reliable locators. Some other points about XPath are as follows. ]
li => [ XPath is a language used for locating nodes in XML documents. ]

li => [ Example: //html/body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div/div/fieldset/form/div[1]/input[1] ]
strong => [ XPath Attributes: ]
li => [ XPath Attributes is always recommended when you don't have a suitable id or name attribute for the element you want to locate. ]
li => [ Syntax: //htmltag[@attribute1='value1' and @attribute2='value2'] ]
li => [ Example: //input[@id='passwd' and @placeholder='password'] ]
h3 => [ 19) What is the difference between "/" and "//" in XPath? ]
p => [  Single Slash "/":  Single slash is used to create XPath with absolute path. ]

p => [ TypeKeys() will trigger JavaScript event in most of the cases whereas .type() won't. ]
h3 => [ 24) What is the difference between "type" and "typeAndWait" command? ]
p => [ "type" command is used to type keyboard key values into the text box of software web application. It can also be used for selecting values of combo box whereas "typeAndWait" command is used when your typing is completed and software web page start reloading. This command will wait for software application page to reload. If there is no page reload event on typing, you have to use a simple "type" command. ]
h3 => [ 25) What is the difference between findElement() and findElements()? ]
p => [  findElement():  It is used to find the first element within the current page using the given "locating mechanism". It returns a single WebElement. ]

li => [ Explicit Wait ]
h3 => [ 27) What is the main disadvantage of implicit wait? ]
p => [ The main disadvantage of implicit wait is that it slows down test performance. ]
p => [ Another disadvantage of implicit wait is: ]
p => [ Suppose, you set the waiting limit to be 10 seconds, and the elements appear in the DOM in 11 seconds, your tests will be failed because you told it to wait a maximum of 10 seconds. ]
h3 => [ 28) What is Selenium Grid? ]
p => [ Selenium Grid facilitates you to distribute your tests on multiple machines and all of them at the same time. So, you can execute tests on Internet Explorer on Windows and Safari on Mac machine using the same text script. It reduces the time of test execution and provides quick feedback. ]
h3 => [ Advance Level - Selenium Interview Questions ]
