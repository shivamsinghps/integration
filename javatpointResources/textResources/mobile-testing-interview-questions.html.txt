The Robo-electric framework lets us run Android tests directly on JVM without requiring a device or an emulator. ]
h3 => [ 25) What do you understand by installation testing and uninstall testing? ]
p => [ Installation testing ensures that the installation process will go smoothly without any difficulty faced by the user. On the other hand, uninstall testing ensures that the uninstalling should sweep the app-related data only once.  ]
h3 => [ 26) While performing end-to-end mobile testing, what are the primary criteria you have to consider? ]
p => [ In an end-to-end mobile testing process, the QA team must test the entire application from beginning to end to ensure its flow behaves as expected. Throughout these steps, we have to consider the following critical requirements: ]
