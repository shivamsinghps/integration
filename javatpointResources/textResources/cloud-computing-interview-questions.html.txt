p => [ Community cloud ]
h3 => [ 13) What is private cloud? ]
p => [ Private clouds are used to keep the strategic operations and other reasons secure. It is a complete platform which is fully functional and can be owned, operated and restricted to only an organization or an industry. Now a day, most of the organizations have moved to private clouds due to security concerns. Virtual private cloud is being used that operate by a hosting company. ]

h3 => [ 15) What are Hybrid clouds? ]
p => [ Hybrid clouds are the combination of public clouds and private clouds. It is preferred over both the clouds because it applies most robust approach to implement cloud architecture. It includes the functionalities and features of both the worlds. It allows organizations to create their own cloud and allow them to give the control over to someone else as well. ]
h3 => [ 16) What is the difference between cloud computing and mobile computing? ]
p => [ Mobile computing and cloud computing are slightly same in concept. Mobile computing uses the concept of cloud computing . Cloud computing provides users the data which they required while in mobile computing, applications run on the remote server and gives user the access for storage and manage. ]
h3 => [ 17) What is the difference between scalability and elasticity? ]
p => [  Scalability  is a characteristic of cloud computing which is used to handle the increasing workload by increasing in proportion amount of resource capacity. By the use of scalability, the architecture provides on demand resources if the requirement is being raised by the traffic. Whereas,  Elasticity  is a characteristic which provides the concept of commissioning and decommissioning of large amount of resource capacity dynamically. It is measured by the speed by which the resources are coming on demand and the usage of the resources. ]
h3 => [ 18) What are the security benefits of cloud computing? ]
p => [ Cloud computing authorizes the application service, so it is used in identity management. ]
p => [ It provides permissions to the users so that they can control the access of another user who is entering into the cloud environment. ]
h3 => [ 19) What is the usage of utility computing? ]
p => [ Utility computing is a plug-in managed by an organization which decides what type of services has to be deployed from the cloud. It facilitates users to pay only for what they use. ]
h3 => [ 20) What is "EUCALYPTUS" in cloud computing? Why is it used? ]
p => [ It is an acronym stands for Elastic Utility Computing Architecture For Linking Your Program To Useful Systems. It is an open source software infrastructure in cloud computing and used to implement clusters in cloud computing platform. It creates public, private and hybrid cloud. It facilitate a user to create his own data center into a private cloud and use its functionalities to many other organizations. ]
h3 => [ 21) Explain System integrators in cloud computing. ]
p => [ System integrator provides a strategy of a complicated process used to design a cloud platform. It creates more accurate hybrid and private cloud network because integrator have all the knowledge about the data center creation. ]
