h3 => [ 21) What is the use of a Design workspace window? ]
p => [  It is a layout where we can design our jobs. And we can access the  Designer tab  and  code tab,  where the designer tab displays the job graphically and the code tab shows the generated code and also identify the possible errors. ]
h3 => [ 22) What is the Configuration tab in Talend main window? ]
p => [  The  configuration tab  displays the properties of the selected element in a design workspace window. And these properties can be edit to change and set the parameters related to a particular component or the job, and the  Run tab  is used to execute our jobs.  ]
h3 => [ 23) What is Routine in Talend open studio? ]
p => [  The  Routines  are reusable pieces of Java code. It enables us to write custom code in Java, to improve Job capacity, optimize data processing, and extend Talend Studio features. ]
p => [ There are two types of routines available in Talend Studio, which are as follows: ]
li => [ System routines ]
li => [ User routines ]

p => [ The main objective of the tSortRow component is to help us to create metrics and classification of the table. ]
h3 => [ 28) What is the tLoqateAddressRow component? ]
p => [  The  tLoqateAddressRow  component is used to compare address data against reference data to make sure that it is correct and complete. If any changes needed, we can correct the spelling, add the missing address data like city, area of the city, postcode or region, and any other related data. ]
h3 => [ 29) Why we use the tXMLMap component? ]
p => [  The  tXMLMap  component is used to transform and route data from single or multiple sources to single or multiple destinations. ]
