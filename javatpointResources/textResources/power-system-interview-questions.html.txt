h1 => [ Power System Interview Questions ]
p => [ A list of top frequently asked Power System interview questions and answers are given below. ]
h3 => [ 1) What is the Power plant or Power Station? ]
p => [ The generation, distribution, and transmission system together constitute a network called as Power plant. The power plant uses the form of energy such as coal, diesel and converts it into electrical energy. An example of the power system is a grid that supplies power to the other system. ]
h3 => [ 2) What do you mean by the zone of protection? ]
p => [ The protection is provided in the system to protect each and every element of the power system. If any fault occurs in the system then the relays associated with it trip all the circuit breaker so that the faulty element gets removed from the power system. This Security provided to the system is called the 'Zone of protection'. ]
h3 => [ 3) What is the difference between the Transmission line and distribution line? ]
p => [ The main work of transmission line and distribution line is to transfer power from one place to another but the difference between transmission and distribution line is based on the factors like the type of phase, the distribution line because the wire for transmission line is thick and for distribution line is thin, the transmission line requires three phase supply for carrying electricity and distribution line requires single phase supply for carrying electricity. ]

h3 => [ 12) Why does the adjacent zone of protection overlap? ]
p => [ Adjacent zone of protection overlap because if we do not overlap then some portion of the power system will be left out unprotected. ]
h3 => [ 13) What is Electrical Grounding? ]
p => [ Electrical grounding or merely grounding is a safety measure used to prevent people accidentally coming in contact with the hazardous electrical faults. ]
h3 => [ 14) What is Electrical Earthing? ]

p => [ The difference between electrical earthing and electrical grounding is that in grounding the current carrying part is connected to the ground, whereas in earthing the non-current carrying part is connected to the ground. Grounding does not have zero potential but earthing has zero potential. ]
h3 => [ 17) What is the importance of earthing? ]

h3 => [ 20) Draw the Single Line Diagram of the Power Station? ]
h3 => [ 21) How do you select the pickup value of the relay? ]
p => [ The pickup value of the relay should be more than the maximum load and it should allow the normal load as well as the certain degree of overload to be supplied. The relay should be sensitive enough to respond to the smallest fault, therefore, the pickup value should be less than the smallest fault current. ]
h3 => [ 22) What is the difference between a fuse and a breaker? ]
p => [ The difference between Fuse and a circuit breaker is that fuse works on the principle of the thermal and electrical properties of the conducting materials, whereas the circuit breaker works on the principle of electromagnetism and switching principle. We can use the fuses only once but circuit breakers can be used many more times, and the breaking capacity of the fuse is low as compared with the circuit breaker. ]
h3 => [ 23) What is the difference between the relay and the circuit breaker? ]
p => [ The difference between the relay and the circuit breaker is that relay is a switching device that gives the signal to the circuit breaker in case of fault occurrence, whereas circuit breaker breaks the circuit automatically when receives the signal. ]
h3 => [ 24)	What is the difference between resistance grounding system and resistance earthing system? ]
p => [ In resistance grounding, one or more resistance is connected to the neutral of the system. Resistance winding limits the fault current and protects the system from transient overvoltages. The arcing ground risk is decreased by the resistance grounding and permits the ground fault protection, whereas resistance earthing system is provided in electric equipment to protect the equipment from the occurrence of the fault in the system. ]
h3 => [ 25) What is Primary and Backup protection? ]
p => [ Primary protection also known as main protection is the first line of protection which provides quick acting and clearing of the fault within the boundary of the elements it protects. In the electrical installation, the primary protection is provided to each section. Whereas the backup protection provides the backup to the primary or main protection whenever it fails in operation and cut out for repair. For the proper functioning of the electrical system back up protection is essential. ]
h3 => [ 26) What is meant by Bus Bar Protection? ]
p => [ When the fault occurs on the bus bar, then the whole of the supply gets interrupted, and all the feeders are disconnected in this case Busbar protection is provided to the system to eliminate the occurrence of these faults. For removing the faults the entire circuits connecting the faulty section needs to be open. ]
