h1 => [ Laravel Interview Questions ]
p => [  A list of top frequently asked  Laravel Interview Questions and answers  are given below.  ]
h3 => [ 1) What is Laravel? ]
p => [  Laravel is free to use, open-source web framework based on PHP. It is developed by  Taylor Otwell  . It supports the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. Laravel provides an expressive and elegant syntax, which is useful for creating a wonderful web application easily and quickly. The first version of Laravel was released on  9th June 2011  . ]
p => [  As of SitePoint survey in March 2015, Laravel was voted as one of the most popular PHP frameworks along with  Symfony, Nette, CodeIgniter, and Yii2  . ]
h3 => [ 2) What are the main features of Laravel? ]
p => [ Some of the main features of Laravel are: ]
li => [ Eloquent ORM ]
li => [ Query builder ]
li => [ Reverse Routing ]
li => [ Restful Controllers ]
li => [ Migrations ]
li => [ Database Seeding ]
li => [ Unit Testing ]
li => [ Homestead ]
h3 => [ 3) What do you understand by Eloquent ORM? ]
p => [  Eloquent ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)  is one of the main features of the Laravel framework. It may be defined as an advanced PHP implementation of the active record pattern. ]
em => [ Active record pattern is an architectural pattern which is found in software. It is responsible for keeping in-memory object data in relational databases ]
p => [ Eloquent ORM is also responsible for providing the internal methods at the same time when enforcing constraints on the relationship between database objects. Eloquent ORM represents database tables as classes, with their object instances tied to single table rows, while following the active record pattern. ]
h3 => [ 4) What is Query Builder in Laravel? ]
p => [ Laravel's Query Builder provides more direct access to the database, alternative to the Eloquent ORM. It doesn't require SQL queries to be written directly. Instead, it offers a set of classes and methods which are capable of building queries programmatically. It also allows specific caching of the results of the executed queries. ]
h3 => [ 5) Write down the name of some aggregates methods provided by the Laravel's query builder. ]
p => [ Some of the methods that Query Builder provides are: ]
li => [ count() ]
li => [ max() ]
li => [ min() ]
li => [ avg() ]
li => [ sum() ]
h3 => [ 6) What is routing? ]
p => [  All Laravel routes are defined in route files, which are stored in the routes directory. These files are loaded by the MVC framework. The routes/web.php files define routes that are available for the web interface. Those routes are allotted as the web middleware group, which provide features such as  session state  and  CSRF  protection. The routes available in  routes/api.php  are stateless and are allotted as the API middleware group. For most of the applications, one should start by defining routes in routes/web.php file. ]
h3 => [ 7) What do you understand by Reverse routing? ]
p => [ Reverse routing in Laravel is used to generate the URL based on name or symbol. It defines a relationship between the links and, Laravel routes, and it is possible to make later changes to the routes to be automatically propagated into relevant links. When the links are generated using names of existing routes, the appropriate uniform resource identifiers (URIs) are automatically generated by Laravel. Reverse routing provides flexibility to the application and helps the developer to write cleaner codes. ]
p => [ Route Declaration: ]
p => [ A link can be created to it using reverse routing, which can be further transferred in any parameter that we have defined. If optional parameters are not supplied, they are removed automatically from the generated links. ]
p => [  By using it, a URL like  https://abc.go.com/loginwill  be created automatically. ]
h3 => [ 8) How will you describe Bundles in Laravel? ]
p => [  In Laravel, Bundles are also known as  Packages . Packages are the primary way to add more functionality to Laravel. Packages can be anything, from a great way to work with dates like Carbon, or an entire BDD testing framework like  Behat . Laravel also provides support for creating custom packages. ]
p => [  There are different types of packages. Some of them are stand-alone packages. This means they can work with any PHP framework. The frameworks like  Carbon and Behat  are examples of stand-alone packages. Other packages are intended for use with Laravel. These packages may contain routes, controllers, views, and configurations which are mainly designed to enhance a Laravel application. ]
h3 => [ 9) What is a composer, and how can we install Laravel by the composer? ]
p => [ A composer is a dependency manager in PHP. It manages the dependencies which are required for a project. It means that the composer will pull in all the necessary libraries, dependencies, and manage all at a single place. ]
strong => [ Laravel Installation Steps: ]
a => [ https://getcomposer.org/download/ ]
li => [ Open command prompt ]
li => [ Go to htdocs folder ]
li => [ Run the below command under C:\xampp\htdocs&gt; ]
h3 => [ 10) Does Laravel support caching? ]
p => [  Yes, Laravel provides support for popular caching backends like  Memcached  and  Redis . ]
p => [ By default, Laravel is configured to use file cache driver, which is used to store the serialized or cached objects in the file system. For huge projects, it is suggested to use Memcached or Redis. ]
h3 => [ 11) How to clear cache in Laravel? ]
p => [ The syntax to clear cache in Laravel is given below: ]
li => [ php artisan cache: clear ]
li => [ php artisan config: clear ]
li => [ php artisan cache: clear ]
h3 => [ 12) How will you explain middleware in Laravel? ]
p => [ As the name suggests, middleware works as a middleman between request and response. Middleware is a form of HTTP requests filtering mechanism. For example, Laravel consists of middleware which verifies whether the user of the application is authenticated or not. If a user is authenticated and trying to access the dashboard then, the middleware will redirect that user to home page; otherwise, a user will be redirected to the login page. ]
p => [ There are two types of middleware available in Laravel: ]
strong => [ Global Middleware ]
p => [ It will run on every HTTP request of the application. ]
strong => [ Route Middleware ]
p => [ It will be assigned to a specific route. ]
strong => [ Syntax ]
strong => [ Example ]
p => [ Now, UserMiddleware.php file will be created in app/Http/Middleware. ]
h3 => [ 13) What do you understand by database migrations in Laravel? How can we use it? ]
p => [  Migrations can be defined as version control for the database, which allows us to modify and share the application's database schema easily. Migrations are commonly paired with  Laravel's schema builder  to build the application's database schema easily. ]
p => [  A migration file includes two methods,  up()  and  down() . A method up() is used to add new tables, columns or indexes database and the down() method is used to reverse the operations performed by the up() method. ]
p => [  We can generate a migration and its file by using the  make:migration . ]
strong => [ Syntax ]
p => [ By using it, a current date blog.php file will be created in database/migrations. ]
h3 => [ 14) What do you know about Service providers in Laravel? ]
p => [ Service providers can be defined as the central place to configure all the entire Laravel applications. Applications, as well as Laravel's core services, are bootstrapped via service providers. These are powerful tools for maintaining class dependencies and performing dependency injection. Service providers also instruct Laravel to bind various components into the Laravel's Service Container. ]
p => [ An artisan command is given here which can be used to generate a service provider: ]
p => [ Almost, all the service providers extend the Illuminate\Support\ServiceProviderclass. Most of the service providers contain below-listed functions in its file: ]
li => [ Register() Function ]
li => [ Boot() Function ]
p => [ Within the Register() method, one should only bind things into the service container. One should never attempt to register any event listeners, routes, or any other piece of functionality within the Register() method. ]
h3 => [ 15) How can we get data between two dates using Query in Laravel? ]
p => [  We can use  whereBetween()  method to retrieve the data between two dates with Query. ]
strong => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 16) What do you know about CSRF token in Laravel? How can someone turn off CSRF protection for a specific route? ]
p => [  CSRF protection stands for  Cross-Site Request Forgery  protection. CSRF detects unauthorized attacks on web applications by the unauthorized users of a system. The built-in CSRF plug-in is used to create CSRF tokens so that it can verify all the operations and requests sent by an active authenticated user. ]
p => [ To turn off CSRF protection for a specific route, we can add that specific URL or Route in $except variable which is present in the app\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken.phpfile. ]
strong => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 17) List some official packages provided by Laravel? ]
p => [ There are some official packages provided by Laravel which are given below: ]
strong => [ Cashier ]
p => [ Laravel cashier implements an expressive, fluent interface to Stripe's and Braintree's subscription billing services. It controls almost all of the boilerplate subscription billing code you are dreading writing. Moreover, the cashier can also control coupons, subscription quantities, swapping subscription, cancellation grace periods, and even generate invoice PDFs. ]
strong => [ Envoy ]
p => [  Laravel Envoy is responsible for providing a clean, minimal syntax for defining frequent tasks that we run on our remote servers. Using Blade style syntax, one can quickly arrange tasks for deployment, Artisan commands, and more. Envoy only provides support for  Mac and Linux . ]
strong => [ Passport ]
p => [  Laravel is used to create API authentication to act as a breeze with the help of Laravel passport. It further provides a full  Oauth2  server implementation for Laravel application in a matter of minutes. Passport is usually assembled on top of  League OAuth2  server which is maintained by  Alex Bilbie . ]
strong => [ Scout ]
p => [ Laravel Scout is used for providing a simple, driver-based solution for adding full-text search to the eloquent models. Using model observers, Scout automatically keeps search indexes in sync with eloquent records. ]
strong => [ Socialite ]
p => [ Laravel Socialite is used for providing an expressive, fluent interface to OAuth authentication with Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Linkedln, etc. It controls almost all the boilerplate social authentication code that you are dreading writing. ]
h3 => [ 18) What do you understand by Unit testing? ]
p => [  Unit testing is built-in testing provided as an integral part of Laravel. It consists of unit tests which detect and prevent regressions in the framework. Unit tests can be run through the available  artisan  command-line utility. ]
h3 => [ 19) What do you know about Facades in Laravel? Explain. ]
p => [ Laravel Facades provide static-like interface classes which are available in the application's service container. Laravel self-ships with several available facades, gives access to almost all features of Laravel. Facades also help to access a service directly from the container itself. It is described in the Illuminate\Support\Facades namespace. Hence, it is easy to use. ]
strong => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 20) How can we check the Laravel current version? ]
p => [  One can easily check the current version of Laravel installation using the  -version  option of artisan command. ]
h3 => [ 21) How will you explain dd() function in Laravel? ]
p => [  dd stands for " Dump and Die ." Laravel's dd() function can be defined as a helper function, which is used to dump a variable's contents to the browser and prevent the further script execution. ]
strong => [ Example ]
h3 => [ 22) What do you know about PHP artisan? Mention some artisan command. ]
p => [ PHP artisan is a command-line interface/tool provided with Laravel. It consists of several useful commands which can be helpful while building an application. There are few artisan commands given below: ]
strong => [ PHP artisan list ]
p => [ A 'list' command is used to view a list of all available Artisan commands. ]
strong => [ PHP artisan help ]
p => [ Every command also contains a 'help' screen, which is used to display and describe the command's available arguments and options. To display a help screen, run 'help' command. ]
strong => [ PHP artisan tinker ]

strong => [ PHP artisan -version ]
p => [ By using this command, one can view the current version of Laravel installation. ]
strong => [ PHP artisan make model model_name ]
p => [ This command creates a model 'model_name.php' under the 'app' directory.  ]
strong => [ PHP artisan make controller controller_name ]
p => [ This command is used to build a new controller file in app/Http/Controllers folder.  ]
h3 => [ 23) How will you explain Events in Laravel? ]
p => [ An event is an activity or occurrence recognized and handled by the program. Events in Laravel provide simple observer implementations which allow us to subscribe and listen for events within our application. The event classes are stored in app/Events, while their listeners are stored in app/Listeners of our application. These can be generated using Artisan console commands. A single event may contain multiple listeners that do not depend on each other.  ]
p => [ There are some events examples in Laravel which are: ]
li => [ A new user is registered. ]
li => [ A new comment is posted. ]
li => [ User login/logout. ]
li => [ A new product is added. ]
h3 => [ 24) What are the validations in Laravel? ]
p => [ Validations are approaches that Laravel use to validate the incoming data within the application. ]
p => [  They are the handy way to ensure that data is in a clean and expected format before it gets entered into the database. Laravel consists of several different ways to validate the incoming data of the application. By default, the base controller class of Laravel uses a  ValidatesRequests  trait to validate all the incoming HTTP requests with the help of powerful validation rules. ]
h3 => [ 25) What do you understand by Lumen? ]
p => [  Lumen is a PHP micro-framework built on Laravel's top components. It is created by  Taylor Otwell  (creator of Laravel). It is created for building Laravel based micro-services and blazing fast APIs. It is one of the fastest micro-frameworks available. Lumen is not a complete web framework like Laravel and used for creating APIs only. Therefore, most of the components, such as HTTP sessions, cookies, and templating, are excluded from Lumen.  Lumen  provides support for features such as logging, routing, caching queues, validation, error handling, middleware, dependency injection, controllers, blade templating, command scheduler, database abstraction, the service container, and Eloquent ORM, etc. ]
p => [ One can install Lumen using composer by running the command given below: ]
h3 => [ 26) Which template engine is used by Laravel? ]
p => [  The  blade  is a simple but powerful templating engine provided with Laravel. There is no restriction to use PHP codes in the views. All the blade views are compiled into simple PHP code and cached until they are modified. Blade adds effectively zero overhead to our application. Blade view files in Laravel use the .blade.phpfile extension and are saved in the resources/views directory. ]
h3 => [ 27) Explain the Service container and its advantages. ]
p => [  Service container in Laravel is one of the most powerful features. It is an important, powerful tool for resolving class dependencies and performing dependency injection in Laravel. It is also known as  IoC container . ]
p => [ Dependency injection is a term which essentially means that class dependencies are "injected" into the class by the constructor or, in some cases," setter" methods. ]
strong => [ Advantages of Service Container ]
li => [ It can handle class dependencies on object creation. ]
li => [ It can combine interfaces to concrete classes. ]
h3 => [ 28) What do you know about Laravel Contracts? ]
