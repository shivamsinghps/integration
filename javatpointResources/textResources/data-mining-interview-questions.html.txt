h3 => [ 1) What is Data Mining? / What do you understand by Data Mining? ]
p => [ Data Mining is a process of extracting usable data from a more extensive set of raw data by using some methods along with machine learning, statistics, and database systems. It implies analyzing data patterns in large batches of data using one or more software. Data mining is a specific subfield of Computer Science and Statistics. The main goal of Data Mining is to extract information (using intelligent methods) from a data set and transform the information into an understandable structure for further use. ]
p => [ Using Data Mining, businesses can learn more about their customers and develop more effective strategies to expand their various business functions and utilize their resources more optimally and insightfully. Data mining consists of useful data collection and warehousing as well as computer processing. It makes businesses to attain their objective and makes better decisions. ]
h3 => [ 2) What are the key features of Data Mining? ]
p => [ Data mining has many applications in multiple fields, like science and research. Following is the list of key features of Data Mining: ]
li => [ By trend and behavior analysis of the data, we can create automatic pattern predictions. ]
li => [ We can create decision-oriented information. ]
li => [ We can focus on large data sets and databases for analysis. ]
li => [ We can predict the behavior based on the outcomes. ]

h3 => [ 3) What are the different fields where data mining is used?  ]
p => [ Data Mining is mainly used by big consumer-based companies that focus on retail, financial, communication, and marketing fields. It is used to get the consumer's transactional data pattern to determine price, customer preferences, and product positioning, which later impact sales, customer satisfaction, and corporate profits. ]
p => [ Following is the list of most important areas where data mining is widely used: ]
strong => [ Healthcare and Personal Grooming ]
p => [ Data mining has a significant impact in the field of healthcare. It uses data and analytics to identify the best practices that can improve care and reduce costs. Scientists use several Data Mining approaches like multi-dimensional databases, machine learning, soft computing, data visualization, statistics, etc., to make things easy for patients. Using Data Mining, we can predict the volume of patients in every category and make sure that the patients get the appropriate care at the right place and at the right time. ]
strong => [ Market Basket Analysis ]
p => [ This modeling technique follows the theory that if you buy a specific group of items, you are more likely to buy another group of items. Using this technique, the retailer can understand the purchase behavior of a buyer and change the store's layout according to the buyer's needs. ]
p => [  Education &amp; Training   ]
p => [ Educational Data Mining is used to identify and predict the students' future learning behavior. If a student is studying a particular course, then the institutes can know which related course they may apply later by using Data Mining. This is also beneficial to make focus on what to teach and how to teach. The institutes can capture the learning pattern of the students and use to develop techniques to teach them. ]
strong => [ Manufacturing Engineering ]
p => [ By using Data mining tools, we can discover patterns in complex manufacturing processes. We can use this to predict the product development span time, cost, and dependencies, among other tasks. ]

h3 => [ 6) What are the different techniques used for Data Mining?  ]
p => [ Following is the list of most important Data Mining techniques: ]
p => [  Prediction:  This technique specifies the relationship between independent and dependent instances. For example, while considering sales data, if we want to predict the future profit, the sale acts as a separate instance, whereas the payoff is the dependent instance. Accordingly, based on sales and profit's historical data, the associated profit is the predicted value. ]
p => [  Decision trees:  It specifies a tree structure where the decision tree's root acts as a condition/question having multiple answers. Each answer sets to specific data that helps in determining the final decision based on the data. ]
p => [  Clustering analysis:  This technique specifies that a cluster of objects having similar characteristics is formed automatically. The clustering method defines classes and then places suitable objects in each class. ]
p => [  Sequential Patterns:  This technique is used to specify the pattern analysis used for discovering identical patterns in transaction data or regular events. For example, customers' historical data helps a brand identify the patterns in the transactions that happened in the past year. ]
p => [  Classification Analysis:  This is a Machine Learning based method in which each item in a particular set is classified into predefined groups. It uses advanced techniques like linear programming, neural networks, decision trees, etc. ]
p => [  Association rule learning:  This technique is used to create a pattern based on the items' relationship in a single transaction. ]
h3 => [ 7) What do you understand by Data Purging?  ]
p => [ Data Purging is a process that is used in database management systems to maintain relevant data in a database. It is used to clean the junk data by eliminating or deleting the row and columns' unnecessary NULL values. It is essential because whenever we need to load new data in the database, we have to purge the irrelevant data from the database. ]
p => [ Using Data Purging of the database frequently, we can remove the junk data that takes up a fair amount of database memory and slow down the database's performance. So, we can say that data purging is mandatory when the database's size gets too large. ]

td => [ The OLTP process captures and maintains transaction data in a database. ]
td => [ This process is mainly used in data mining, analytics, and business intelligence projects. ]
td => [ In this process, each transaction involves individual database records made up of multiple fields or columns. For example, banking and credit card activity or retail checkout scanning. ]
td => [ In OLAP, the main focus is on response time to these complex queries. Each query involves one or more columns of data aggregated from many rows. ]
td => [ In OLTP, the main focus is on fast processing because OLTP databases are read, written, and updated frequently. If a transaction fails, built-in system logic ensures data integrity. ]
td => [ Low volumes of transactions categorize OLAP. ]
td => [ Short online transactions categorize OLTP. ]
td => [ An example of OLAP is the year-over-year financial performance or marketing lead generation trends of an organization. ]
td => [ An example of OLTP is banking and credit card activity or retail checkout scanning. ]
td => [ The query failure in OLAP does not interrupt or delay transaction processing for customers, but it can delay or impact business intelligence insights' accuracy. ]

li => [ Its cubes are smaller than MOLAP, so only precise data is fetched for processing. ]
li => [ It is best when data volume is expected to increase over time. ]
li => [ Its processing ability is higher as compared to ROLAP and MOLAP systems. ]
strong => [ Disadvantages of using HOLAP storage model: ]
li => [ In this storage model, both ROLAP and MOLAP are combined to form HOLAP, so the data volume is large. ]
li => [ It occupies a lot of storage space, as it contains the data from relational databases and multidimensional databases. ]
li => [ The processing speed is slow while querying. ]
li => [ It requires system processing whenever data is updated, inserted, or deleted in the database. ]
li => [ We need to update the cache whenever an update happens in the database associated with the stored queries and relational data. ]
