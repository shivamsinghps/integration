p => [ The Angular 8 components are the list of classes with decorators that mainly mark their own types and provide metadata that guide Angular to do things. ]
p => [  Every Angular application always has at least one component known as a root component that connects a page hierarchy with page DOM. Each component defines a class that contains application data and logic and is associated with an  HTML  template that defines a view to be displayed in a target environment. ]
h3 => [ 21) What is the usage of NgUpgrade in Angular 8? ]
p => [ The NgModules in Angular 8 is used for the following things: ]
li => [ The NgModule is a class marked by the @NgModule decorator where the @NgModule decorator is used to take a metadata object that describes how to compile a component's template and how to create an injector at runtime. ]
li => [ The NgModules is used to configure the injector and the compiler and also help to organize the related things together. ]
li => [ The NgModule is used to identify the module's own components, directives, and pipes. It can also make some of them public, through the exports property, to facilitate external components to use them. ]
h3 => [ 22) What is the usage of NgUpgrade in Angular 8? ]
p => [ The NgUpgrade is an Angular 8 library mainly used to integrate both AngularJS and Angular components in the application. The NgUpgrade library is also used to bridge the gap between the Dependency Injection Systems in both AngularJS and Angular. ]
h3 => [ 23) What is the usage of Angular 8 ngFor Directive? ]
p => [ The Angular 8 ngFor directive is used to repeat a portion of the HTML template once per each item from an iterable list (Collection). The ngFor is an Angular structural directive and is similar to ngRepeat in AngularJS. Some local variables like Index, First, Last, odd, and even are exported by ngFor directive. ]
strong => [ Syntax for ngFor Directive ]
p => [  Read more information about ngFor directive:  https://www.javatpoint.com/angular-8-ngfor-directive ]
h3 => [ 24) What is the usage of Angular 8 ngIf Directive? ]
p => [ The Angular 8 ngIf directive is a structural directive that is used to add or remove HTML elements according to the expression. The expression must return a Boolean value true or false. You can see the functioning of nglf directive clearly. If the expression is false, then the element is removed. Otherwise, the element is inserted. It is similar to the ng-if directive of AngularJS. ]
strong => [ Syntax for ngIf Directive ]

h3 => [ 25) What is data binding in Angular 8? ]
p => [ Data Binding is one of the key concepts of Angular 8. It is the most eminent technique which is used to link your data to the view layer. It is used to make a communication between the DOM and the TypeScript code of your component. In simple words, you can say that data binding is a communication between the typescript code of your component and your template, which the user sees. It makes it easy to define interactive applications without worrying about pushing and pulling data. ]
p => [ There are two types of data binding i.e., one-way data binding, two-way data binding. ]
h3 => [ 26) What is String Interpolation in Angular 8, and why is it used? ]
p => [ String Interpolation is a one-way data-binding technique in Angular 8. It is used to extract the output data from a TypeScript code to the HTML template view layer. It shows the data from the component to view layer in the form of curly braces. This interpolation technique adds the value of property to the component. ]
strong => [ String Interpolation Example: ]
p => [  Read more information about Angular 8 String Interpolation:  https://www.javatpoint.com/string-interpolation-in-angular-8 ]
h3 => [ 27) What is the Purpose of Event Binding in Angular 8? ]
p => [ Event binding is a technique in Angular 8 used to handle the events raised from the DOM like button click, mouse move etc. When the DOM event happens (eg. click, change, keyup, keydown), it calls the specified method in the component. ]
p => [ See an example of event binding. In this example, the playMusic() method from the component will be called when you will click the button: ]
strong => [ For example: ]

h3 => [ 28) How can you create an app in Angular 8? ]
p => [ You can easily create an Angular 8 web app using Angular CLI. Type the following command to create the Angular 8 web app. ]
strong => [ Syntax: ]
strong => [ Example: ]
p => [  The above command will create an Angular 8 app with the name " myapp ." Then, the Angular CLI will automatically install the required NPM modules. Before this, you must ensure that you have  Node.js , Angular 8, and installed Angular CLI using the following command: ]
p => [ You can also manually create an app folder and install ng dependencies.  ]
h3 => [ 29) What is the main purpose of Angular 8 forms?  ]
p => [ The main purpose of Angular 8 forms is to handle the user's input. You can also use these Angular forms in your application to enable users to log in, update profiles, enter information, or perform many other data-entry tasks. ]
p => [ There are two approaches to handle the user's input through forms in Angular 8: ]
li => [ Reactive forms ]
li => [ Template-driven forms ]
p => [ Both approaches are used to collect user input events from the view, validate the user input, create a form model and data model to update, and provide a way to track changes. ]
h3 => [ 30) What is the use of reactive forms in Angular 8? ]
p => [ Reactive forms use a model-driven approach to handle form inputs where values constantly change over time. It uses an explicit and immutable approach to manage the state of a form at a specific time. Every time the changes occur to the form state, it returns a new state. The reactive forms are used mainly for the following features: ]
li => [ Reactive forms are more robust than template-driven forms. ]
li => [ Reactive forms are more scalable, reusable, and testable. ]
li => [ Reactive forms are preferred to use when the forms are a key part of the application, or the application is already built using reactive patterns. In both cases, reactive forms are best to use. ]
h3 => [ 31) What are the benefits of using Template-driven forms in Angular 8? ]
p => [ Following are the benefits of using Template-driven forms: ]
li => [ You should use Template-driven forms if you want to add a simple form to your application because template-driven forms use two-way data binding to update the data model in the component. By using this, you can see the changes instantly as you make changes in the template and vice versa. ]
li => [ Template-driven forms are easy to use in the application, but they are not as scalable as Reactive forms, so they are preferred to use in test applications for learning purposes. ]
li => [ Template-driven forms are mainly used if your application requires a very basic form and logic. It can easily be managed in a template. ]
h3 => [ 32) What is the difference between reactive forms and Template-driven forms in Angular 8? ]
p => [ Both Reactive forms and Template-driven forms are used to manage and process data differently. Each form offers different advantages. Here, we have compared both forms to see the differences:  ]
th => [ Reactive Forms ]
th => [ Template-driven forms ]
td => [ Reactive forms are more robust, so they are best to use. ]
td => [ Template-driven forms are best if you want to add a simple form to your application. For example email list signup form. ]
td => [ Reactive forms are more scalable, reusable, and testable, so they are preferred to use in professional websites for the industry. ]
td => [ Template-driven forms are easy to use in the application, but they are not as scalable as Reactive forms, so they are preferred to use in test applications for learning purposes. ]
td => [ Reactive forms are most preferred to use if forms are a key part of your application, or your application is already built using reactive patterns. In both cases, reactive forms are best to use. ]
td => [ Template-driven forms are mainly used if your application requires a very basic form and logic. It can easily be managed in a template. ]
h3 => [ 33) What do you mean by Angular Universal? ]
p => [ Angular Universal is a technology that is used to render Angular applications on the server. This process is called SSR (server-side rendering). A simple Angular application is executed on the browser as all the Angular applications are single-page applications, so the rendering always occurs on the browser. This process of rendering single-page applications is called the client-side rendering process (CSR). On the other hand, the Angular Universal is executed on the server, generating static application pages that later get bootstrapped on the client. That's why Angular Universal application generally renders more quickly, giving users a chance to view the application layout before it becomes fully interactive.  ]
h3 => [ 34) What is AOT in Angular 8? ]
p => [ In Angular 8, AOT stands for Ahead-of-Time compiler. It pre-compiles the application components and their templates during the build process. ]
p => [ There are several reasons why apps compiled with AOT launch faster: ]
li => [ The application components that are compiled with AOT execute immediately, without client-side compilation. ]
li => [ Here, templates are embedded as code within their components, so there is no client-side request for template files. That's why it is fast. ]
li => [ The compiler doesn't entertain the unused Angular directives. It's also a reason for its fast response. ]
