p => [ Salesforce is a cloud-based service. It is a customer relationship management (CRM) platform. Salesforce is a software as a Service (SaaS). It helps you to manage customer relationships, integrate with other systems, and build apps. The tool helps you to manage and create a custom solution as per your business requirement.  ]
p => [ Before Salesforce, companies had their servers for customer relationship management (CRM). They were costly and time taking. They were very hard to use. Feasible solution to this problem is to build an affordable CRM software and delivering it entirely online as a service. ]
p => [ In a few years, there has been a significant surge in cloud computing technologies. Salesforce has an immense impact on the world of computing. Salesforce is developed as the fifth largest software company in the world. It is the top CRM service provider. ]
h3 => [ 2) What is an app in Salesforce? ]
p => [ An app is a collection of tabs that works as a unit to provide functionality. Users can switch between apps in force.com app's drop-down menu.  ]
p => [ A Salesforce application is a container of tabs, processes, and services. ]
p => [ We can create new apps by grouping some standard app, customize existing apps according to our work. ]
p => [ Salesforce provides many standard apps such as call center, marketing, sales, etc. ]
p => [ There are two types of Salesforce application: ]
li => [ Custom App ]
li => [ Service cloud control ]

h3 => [ 3) What are objects in Salesforce? ]
p => [ Objects are the database tables in Salesforce. Objects allow storing data specific to the organization in Salesforce. ]
p => [ There are two types of objects in Salesforce: ]
li => [ Standard objects ]
li => [ Custom objects ]
strong => [ Standard objects ]
p => [ Standard objects are such objects that are inbuilt in Salesforce.com.  ]
p => [ Example: accounts, contacts, products, leads, opportunities, campaigns, users, contracts, Report, and dashboards, etc. ]
strong => [ Custom objects ]
p => [ Custom objects are such objects that are created by us. These objects are user-defined objects. Custom objects store information which is important and unique to our organization. ]
p => [ Custom objects are an integral part of any application. They provide a structure for sharing data. ]
p => [ Custom objects hold the following properties. ]
li => [ Custom fields ]
li => [ Relationship to other objects ]
li => [ Page layouts ]
li => [ A custom user interface tab ]
h3 => [ 4) What are user profiles in Salesforce? ]
p => [ User profiles are a group of permissions and settings which provide lightning access to a user. Salesforce admins can assign the users with a profile depending upon their job roles. The user profile includes all the tabs, records, and page access that user require. ]
p => [ You can set up and manage the profile by which you can conventionally create a secure boundary that dictates user's access rights. ]
h3 => [ 5) Can we assign the same profile to two different users? Is it possible that two profiles can be assigned to the same user? ]
p => [ The profile defines the level of access a user can have in Salesforce. ]
p => [ In Salesforce org, it is possible to assign a single profile to any number of users. For example, we can consider a sales or service team in a company. The entire team has access to the same profile. The admin can create one profile for the whole sales team, which will have access to the leads, campaigns, contacts, and other objects deemed necessary by the company. ]
p => [  In this functionality, many users can be assigned with the same profile. In case the team leader needs access to additional records, then it can be done by assigning  permission sets  only for those users. ]
p => [ Each user can be assigned only one profile. ]
h3 => [ 6) What is the difference between Force.com and Salesforce.com? ]
p => [ Salesforce.com is a software as a service (SaaS), and Force.com is a platform as a service (PaaS). ]
h3 => [ 7) What is the relationship in Salesforce? What are its types?  ]
p => [ We can establish a relation between objects in Salesforce. We can associate one object with others. ]
p => [  Example: We have an object  party  (To store information about the party), and you want to associate it with other objects like  people  (information of participants) so that you can associate the object party with people. These relationship types also determine how they handle record sharing, required field in page layouts, data deletion capability. ]
p => [ Salesforce supports the following types of relationships that can be established among objects. ]
li => [ Master-Detail Relationship ]
li => [ Lookup relationship ]
li => [ Self-relationship ]
li => [ External lookup relationship ]
li => [ Indirect lookup relationship ]
li => [ Many-to-Many relationship ]
li => [ Hierarchical relationship ]
h3 => [ 8) What is Master-detail relationship? ]
p => [ It's a tightly coupled relationship among Salesforce objects. In the Master-detail relationship, the parent record controls the behavior of the child record regarding visibility and sharing. If a master record gets deleted, then the child records associated with it are also deleted. The security setting of the parent object applies to the child object. ]
strong => [ Example: ]
p => [  If we create a Master-detail relationship between the objects  party  and  people . Where a party is a parent object, and people is a child object. Then if we delete party record, all the associated record will also get deleted. ]
p => [  When two objects form a Master-detail relationship, we can create a unique type of field over the master object, called  Roll-up summary . ]
p => [ A Roll-up summary allows us to calculate values related to child record, such as the number of child record, average, sum, etc., linked to a parent record. ]
h3 => [ 9) What is the lookup relationship? ]
p => [ It's a loosely coupled relationship among Salesforce objects. In the Lookup relationship, both parent and child have their sharing setting and security controls, which means if a parent record gets deleted, then child records remain in the system. ]
p => [ Let's see the party and the people objects. For example, the below figure provdes a visual representation of the Lookup relationship between the party and people objects. ]
p => [ In this diagram, the party object record has been deleted, but the people record is still available. This relationship between objects is Lookup relationship. ]
h3 => [ 10) What are reports in Salesforce? ]
p => [ Reports are an essential part of any business. Descriptions provide a clear picture of the management. ]
p => [ Reports are used to track the process towards its various tasks, control expenditure, increase revenue. Reports help in trend prediction. ]

h3 => [ 11) What are some Governor limits in Salesforce? ]
p => [ Governor limits control how much data and how many records you can store in the shared databases because Salesforce is a multi-tenant architecture based. In other words, Salesforce uses a single database to store the data of multiple customers. ]
p => [ Salesforce introduced the concept of the Governor limits to prevent monopolization of the shared resources between users. ]
p => [ Governor limits are the biggest challenge of a Salesforce developer. This is because if the apex code exceeds the limit, then the issue is a runtime exception that can't be handled. So as a Salesforce developer, you should be very careful while developing application. ]
p => [ Here is a list of some significant Governor limits. ]
li => [ Pre-transaction Apex limits ]
li => [ Static Apex limits ]
li => [ Size-Specific Apex limits ]
li => [ Miscellaneous Apex limits ]

But it is not necessary that all the organizations use the same calendar, some organizations use different calendars and need to change the fiscal year start month. It can be defined whether the fiscal year is based on the start or end of the selected month. ]
p => [ To set up a standard fiscal year navigate to ]
p => [  Select the option of  Standard Fiscal year ]
strong => [ Custom fiscal year ]
