<h1 class="h1">What is Windows?</h1>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/computer/images/windows.png" class="imageright" alt="Windows" />
<p>Windows is a <strong>graphical operating system</strong> developed by Microsoft. It allows users to view and store files, run the software, play games, watch videos, and provides a way to connect to the internet. It was released for both home computing and professional works.</p>
<p>Microsoft introduced the first version as 1.0</p>
<p>It was released for both home computing and professional functions of Windows on <strong>10 November 1983</strong>. Later, it was released on many versions of Windows as well as the current version, Windows 10.</p>
<p>In 1993, the first business-oriented version of Windows was released, which is known as <strong>Windows NT 3.1</strong>. Then it introduced the next versions, <strong>Windows 3.5</strong>, <strong>4/0</strong>, and <strong>Windows 2000</strong>. When the XP Windows was released by Microsoft in 2001, the company designed its various versions for a personal and business environment. It was designed based on standard x86 hardware, like <strong>Intel</strong> and <strong>AMD processor</strong>. Accordingly, it can run on different brands of hardware, such as HP, Dell, and Sony computers, including home-built PCs.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Editions of Windows</h3>
<p>Microsoft has produced several editions of Windows, starting with Windows XP. These versions have the same core operating system, but some versions included advance features with an additional cost. There are two most common editions of Windows:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Windows Home</li>
<li>Windows Professional</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Windows Home</h3>
<p>Windows Home is basic edition of Windows. It offers all the fundamental functions of Windows, such as browsing the web, connecting to the Internet, playing video games, using office software, watching videos. Furthermore, it is less expensive and comes pre-installed with many new computers.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Windows Professional</h3>
<p>Windows Professional is also known as Window Pro or win Pro. It is an enhanced edition of Windows, which is beneficial for power users and small to medium-size businesses. It contains all features of Windows Home as well as the following:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Remote Desktop:</strong> Windows Professional editions allow users to create a remote desktop connection. It provides users the option to connect with another computer remotely, including share the control of its mouse, keyboard, and view display. It is mainly accessed with the help of port 3389. Additionally, we can also use the TeamViewer or VNC application to create a remote desktop connection.</li>
<li><strong>Trusted Boot:</strong> It provides security as encrypting to the boot loader and protects the computer from <strong>rootkits</strong> (Collection of software tools that allow users to enter another computer through an unauthorized way known as rootkits).</li>
<li><strong>Bitlocker:</strong> It allows users to encrypt a storage drive by using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. This feature is present in Windows 7, and Windows Vista (Only ultimate and Enterprise versions), including Windows Server 2008.</li>
</ul>
<p>Business laptops or computers mainly use the Bitlocker feature to protect their data on the computer. As if your computer has been stolen, it is very difficult to break the Bitlocker password. It can be unlocked by entering the correct password only. Furthermore, if you forget your Bitlocker password, it cannot be retrieved.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Windows Sandbox:</strong> A sandbox is located on a computer, network, or an online service enables users to experiment or test computer security without interrupting the system.</li>
<li><strong>Hyper-V:</strong> It stands for a hypervisor, and developed by Microsoft Corporation on 26 June 2008. It is also called Windows Server Virtualization. Hyper-V is used for virtualization of x86-64 servers, running virtual machines and third party software like VirtualBox.</li>
<li><strong>Group policy management:</strong> An admin can specify group policies in an organization to manage different Windows users.</li>
<li>It provides support for the systems that have more than 128 GB of RAM.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it also offers more Windows update installation options as well as flexible scheduling and postponement around 34 days.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Why is Microsoft Windows called Windows?</h3>
<p>When Microsoft Windows was not introduced, all of the Microsoft users were used MS-DOS operating system. Microsoft gave one word to most of its products; it required a new Word that can represent its new <a href="gui-full-form.html">GUI</a> operating system. Microsoft decided to call it Windows because it has the ability to perform several tasks and run applications simultaneously.</p>
<p>Another reason behind calling it Windows was that you could not trademark a common name like Windows. Its official name was Microsoft Windows, the first version 1.0 of Windows was introduced in 1995.</p>
<h3 class="h3">History of Microsoft Windows</h3>

<h3 class="h3">Difference between Linux and Windows OS</h3>
<p>Below is a table to describe the major factors about <a href="linux-tutorial.html">Linux</a> and Windows operating systems:</p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>Topic</th>
<th>Windows</th>
<th>Linux</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Command Line</strong></td>
<td>Windows allows users to use the command line, but not as a Linux command line. To open the command line, click on the Run dialog box and type CMD in the run search bar and press Enter key.</td>
<td>Although the Linux command-line offers more features for administration and daily tasks, it does not offer much to end-users.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Reliability</strong></td>
<td>Windows has improved its reliability in the past few years, but still it is less reliable as compared to Linux.</td>
<td>Linux is more reliable and secure then Windows OS. It mainly focuses on system security, process management, and up-time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Usability</strong></td>
<td>Windows is easier to use as it provides a simple user interface. But its installation process can take more time.</td>
<td>Although Linux has the ability to perform complex tasks easier, its installation process is complicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Security</strong></td>
<td>Microsoft has enhanced the security features in Windows over recent years. As it has a huge user base, mostly for new computer users, it can be easily targeted for malicious coders. Furthermore, among all of the operating systems, Microsoft Windows can be part of developing malware and viruses.</td>
<td>Linux is a more secure operating system as compared to Microsoft Windows. Even attackers found difficulty in breaking the security with the help of Linux.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Support</strong></td>
<td>It provides users the online and integrated help systems, as well as a large number of informative books, are available to provide help for people at all skill levels.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Licensing</strong></td>
<td>Microsoft Windows with license does not allow to modify the software (don't have access to the source code). It can be installed only on the systems with a Windows license key.</td>
<td>Linux operating system with a license offers users the benefit to re-use the source code on any number of systems. It is also allowed the users to modify the software and sell its modified version.</td>
