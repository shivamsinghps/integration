It is an <strong><em>Indian-Aryan language</em></strong> that is mostly spoken in South Asia including various states of India. However, it mostly varies in terms of usage, words, pronunciation, and phonetic form in the Indian states.</p>
<p>In India, Bengali is mostly spoken in West Bengal, Assam, Tripura and Jharkhand. It is also the <strong><em>official language of West Bengal, Assam and Tripura</em></strong> and <strong><em>second official language</em></strong> of Jharkhand. Besides India, it is also the <strong><em>national language of Bangladesh</em></strong> and is also spoken in other parts of the world such as Nepal, Pakistan, America, Middle East, UK, Japan and Canada. The Bengali script or alphabet is written from left to right in the form of horizontal lines and it does not have capital letters. It is based on Brahmi, an ancient script of India and is closely related to the Devanagari alphabet.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="Marathi" class="h2">3) Marathi</h2>
<p>The Marathi language belongs to the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European language family. It is the third most spoken language in India as well as one of the 22 official languages in India. It is <strong><em>spoken by around 8.3 crore people in India</em></strong> that is around <strong><em>6.8 %</em></strong> of the total population of India.

Furthermore, in this state, it is also used in government work, education, media, and business matters. The Goa state of India has also recognized as an official language along with Konkani. Besides this, it is also spoken in Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka, Telangana, etc.</p>
<p>In written form, Marathi was found for the first time in 730AD on a copper-plate in Satara. Most of the early inscriptions of Marathi were written using Kadamba alphabet. Later, since the 13<sup>th</sup> century up to the 19<sup>th</sup> century, it has used Modi alphabets for administrative purposes, whereas the Balbodh version of Devanagari alphabets was used mostly for poetry.</p>
<p>Marathi is <strong><em>evolved from Sanskrit</em></strong> during 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> centuries. It was a widely used Prakrit dialect named Maharashtri at that time. It slowly evolved into Marathi in the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> centuries. Besides India, it is spoken in Israel and Mauritius. Devanagari alphabets are used in writing Marathi.
