<h1 class="h1">Best Movies of All Time</h1>
<p>Life would be boring without creativity and recreational activities. We pass the time by playing, cooking, stitching, and so on. When technology and television were not available, people used to spend time in theatre composing dramas. People enjoyed recreating great epics like the Mahabharata or Shakespeare's stories. Since the first cinematographic machine projected images onto a screen, audiences have been enthralled by cinema. Nonetheless, each cinematic age has produced its own collection of classics and wonders. The best films undoubtedly reflect the zenith of artistic achievement in the contemporary age, making them worthy of repeat viewing. Let us treat ourselves by viewing some of the <strong><em>best movies of all time</em></strong> belonging to different genres, which we can binge-watch at any time and in any place, regardless of our mood.</p>
<h2 class="h2">1. Jai Bhim</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-movies-of-all-time1.png" class="imageright" alt="Best Movies of All Time" />
<p>Based on the true account of the Rajakannu case, which was a type of Habeas Corpus case in the history of the Chennai High Court of India, this film was released in 2021.</p>
<p>The film concentrates on the fundamental issue of social justice and exposes the atrocities that exist in Indian culture. Sir Justice K. Chandru's position in both real and fictional life is extremely inspirational for the audience. The narrative is about a tribal man who is wrongfully accused of robbery and then goes missing from police detention. From the admiration of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin to the enormous response from members of the film industry, it quickly became a must-see Tamil dubbed Hindi Indian film. It received the highest IMDb rating and was the most popular movie of 2021. According to a Twitter report from 2021, it was also one of the most tweeted films. </p>
<h2 class="h2">2. Titanic</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-movies-of-all-time2.png" class="imageright" alt="Best Movies of All Time" />
<p>Films allow you to experience the flavors of other cultures, languages, nationalities, and styles. It is quite beneficial to be aware of the world's various existing identities. As a result, in addition to Bollywood, we must also watch some of Hollywood's best treasures in genres such as horror, romance, and science fiction, among others. When it comes to Hollywood, nothing beats viewing one of its great old love films, such as Titanic, which was released in 1997. James Cameron penned the screenplay and directed the film. It's a historical and fictitious film about the RMS Titanic's sinking. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star as members of different social strata who meet onboard the ship during the doomed voyage and fall in love.</p>
<p>The story begins aboard a research vessel as a team search for the Titanic's wreckage and discovers a box with a painting of a woman wearing a necklace called the Heart of the Ocean, which was dated the same day the Titanic ship was sunk by an iceberg. The woman was later recognized and transported on a research vessel, where she relates the entire Titanic story. The plot begins with actress Kate Winslet, who plays Rose in the film, boarding the Titanic with her affluent fiance Cal and mother, Ruth. Leonardo, on the other hand, plays a lower-class lad who wins a third-class Titanic ticket in a poker game and joins the ship. Rose's mother believes that her daughter's engagement to Cal will bring the family misery while maintaining their upper-class status. Rose tries to commit suicide because she is unhappy with her loveless relationship, but Jack intervenes when he notices her attempting to jump from the ship's stern railing. </p>
<p>Later, Jack persuades her to divert her attention away from suicide, and the two form an emotional bond. Rose's mother and fiance, however, did not approve of their connection, and Rose was repeatedly prodded to avoid speaking with Jack. Rose, on the other hand, recognizes she has feelings for Jack and asks him to paint her naked while wearing only the Pearl of Ocean necklace. Cal later discovers the artwork and devises a scheme to have Jack arrested and charged with stealing the necklace. In the meantime, the ship was hit by an iceberg, and the situation became critical. While everyone else is scrambling for a lifeboat to save their lives, Rose flees the lifeboat carrying her mother and fiance. She runs to Jack, who has been imprisoned on the ship. She was able to get him released, but they were both unable to board a lifeboat in time to save their lives. Rose was wearing Cal's coat at the time, in which he had inadvertently kept the necklace, and it stayed with her till the end. In the story, while the Titanic ship is sinking and crashing into the ocean, Jack promises Rose that she will survive. </p>
<p>Rose's life was saved in the end due to a wooden plank on which she was boarded, while Jack spent the entire time in the freezing water and died of hypothermia. Rose was discovered by the RMS Carpathia, who rescued her from the situation. While telling the account to the researcher team, Rose mentions Cal, who, according to Rose, killed himself after losing his money in the 1929 Great Street Crash in the United States. The researcher team abandons their hunt for the necklace after hearing the elderly lady's story, and Rose takes out her necklace, which she had with her the entire time, and dumps it in the ocean on the stern of the research vessel Keldysh. Following its premiere, this film received numerous commercial honors and was nominated for an Academy Award. It garnered multiple accolades and was the highest-grossing film of all time until the release of another film, 'Avatar,' in 2010. The Titanic film is also protected in the National Film Registry of the United States as a historically and culturally significant film.</p>
<h2 class="h2">3. Sholay</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-movies-of-all-time3.png" class="imageright" alt="Best Movies of All Time" />
<p>Released in 1975, Sholay is a classic Hindi movie that remains one of the most successful Hindi films of all time. The storyline of the movie along with its ensemble star cast of that time shares the credit for its huge success with writers Salim-Javed, director Ramesh Sippy and producer GP Sippy. </p>
<p>In the movie, Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jai (Amitabh Bachchan) are two crooks recruited by Sanjeev Kumar, a retired cop, to apprehend the brutal dacoit Gabbar Singh played by the late Amjad Khan. Basanti and Radha, whom Veeru and Jai had a liking for in the movie, are played by Hema Malini and Jaya Bhaduri, respectively. Over the course of two and a half years, the movie was filmed on the mountainous terrain of Ramanagara, near Bangalore in Karnataka. </p>
<p>The film is set in Ramgarh, a fictional village. Former police officer Thakur Baldev Singh calls a duo of small-time thieves he previously caught in the little village of Ramgarh. Veeru and Jai, Thakur believes, would be suitable for assisting him in capturing Gabbar Singh, a dacoit sought by the police for a 50,000 reward. Thakur instructs them to hand over Gabbar's surviving in exchange for an additional 20,000 incentive. Gabbar sends out members from his gang of dacoits to coerce the locals, but the two crooks, Jai and Veeru, stop them. Later, during the Holi festival, Gabbar and his henchmen invade Ramgarh. Veeru and Jai get surrounded in a tense confrontation. Despite the fact that Thakur has a revolver at his disposal, he refuses to assist them. The dacoits run as Veeru and Jai strike back. Veeru and Jai, on the other hand, are angered by Thakur's passivity and are considering canceling the agreement between them and Thakur and exiting the village. </p>
<p>In an attempt to make Jai and Veeru understand his side of the story, Thakur reveals how Gabbar had slain virtually all of his family members and had both his arms chopped a few years back, adding that he always wore a shawl to hide his mutilation, which is why he couldn't utilize the pistol in that situation. Veeru and Jai alter their minds after seeing how terribly Thakur has incurred the wrath of Gabbar and his men; therefore, they declare that they refuse the incentive money and take a pledge to apprehend Gabbar alive for Thakur. The joyful Veeru and the critical Jai discover themselves developing attachments with the locals while defending Ramgarh. Veeru is smitten by Basanti, a fiery, outgoing youthful lady who makes a livelihood as a horse-cart driver. Jai is infatuated by Radha, the bereaved wife of Thakur's late son, who reciprocates his feelings gently. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the conflict between Gabbar's group and the pair escalates when Gabbar assassinates the local imam's son in order to force the locals to hand over Veeru and Jai. When the villagers disagree and instead ask the two to slay four of Gabbar's men in retaliation for the boy's death. Gabbar seeks revenge fiercely by capturing Veeru and Basanti and forces Basanti to dance ceaselessly or else he will execute Veeru. By fighting the group, Jai saves the day, and the trio is able to escape Gabbar's stronghold while being pursued by his gang members. Jai and Veeru get virtually out of weapons as they struggle from behind a boulder. Veeru was compelled to depart for more weaponry and to put Basanti off somewhere secure, ignorant that Jai was injured in the shooting. Jai subsequently risks himself by firing his last gunshot at short range, igniting dynamite sticks on a footbridge, and killing many of Gabbar's gang members. Veeru reappears, and Jai passes away in his arms. Veeru, furious, storms Gabbar's stronghold, killing his gang members who were left alive and captured Gabbar. Veeru was about to kill Gabbar when Thakur entered and immediately reminded him of the promise he and Jai pledged to bring Gabbar alive to him. Just when Thakur injures Gabbar and his arms with his spike-soled boots, the cops show up to take Gabbar into custody for his misdeeds. Jai's untimely demise once again left Radha alone. Veeru departs Ramgarh and boards the train to discover Basanti awaiting him.</p>
<h2 class="h2">4. Veer Zaara</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-movies-of-all-time4.png" class="imageright" alt="Best Movies of All Time" />
<p>If you enjoy being immersed in the world of romance, Bollywood films are a visual and emotional pleasure. On a weekend night, we want to be able to enjoy the joys of love and passion while still being entertained. So, one such romantic film which all of us must see is Veer Zara in which the King of romance Shah Rukh Khan stars in it along with the dimple girl Preity Zinta as the lead actress. This film was released in 2004 in the Hindi language and directed by Yash Chopra. </p>
<p>This film tells the narrative of Veer, an Indian air force officer, played by Shah Rukh Khan, and Zarara Hayaat, the daughter of a high-profile Pakistani politician, played by Preity Zinta, from which the film's title Veer Zaara was derived. The film scene shows the sets of Pakistan when the Pakistani government decides to review the cases of Indian prisoners as a gesture of goodwill. As Saamiya, Rani Mukherjee plays a Pakistani lawyer who defends prisoner 786. When the lawyer met with him, she discovered that the prisoner had not spoken to anyone in 22 years. Then she refers to him as Veer, and he begins to tell his story about what happened in his past. The Air Force officer recounts how he rescued Zaara's life when she arrived in India and fell in love with her, taking her back to his village and introducing her to his family. </p>
<p>When Zaara was about to board a train back to Pakistan, Veer confessed his love for her, despite learning that she had a fiance and was about to marry. Zaara, too discovers her love for Veer when she returns to Pakistan, but she is unable to express it owing to her father's reputation. However, Zaara's friend discovers this and contacts Veer, who agrees to take Zaara back to India with him. On the other hand, Veer quits his work and travels to Pakistan in search of Zaara. However, Zaara's mother, Mariyam, begs Veer to leave her daughter because of her father's reputation, which Veer agrees to and decides to return to India. But fate had other plans for him, and when he arrived in Pakistan to meet Zaara, he was unjustly accused of being an Indian spy. Zaara's fiance orchestrated the entire disaster, and he was imprisoned for several years. Veer asks Saamiya not to include Zaara's name anywhere in the lawsuit after narrating the full scenario because she is married, and he does not want his wedded life damaged. After hearing the entire story, Saamiya double-checked it by traveling to Veer's village in India to verify his identity. She was surprised to find Zaara in the village when she returned to India. Zaara explains that she believed Veer had died in a bus accident, so she divorced her fiance in Pakistan and returned to India to take care of the girl's school in Veer's village, which was also his ambition to maintain functioning. Saamiya returns to Pakistan with Zaara and works to prove Veer's innocence as a spy. </p>
<p>After many years, Veer and Zaara were reunited there. Following their reunion, the two marry near the Wagah border and say their goodbyes to the lawyer before returning to their village in India. This picture was such a sympathetic portrayal of two lovers from two different countries, with its story, music, and dazzling spectacle, that it became the biggest grossing film of the year and garnered numerous awards worldwide. It is without a doubt one of the best romantic films ever made in India. </p>
<h2 class="h2">5. Annabelle</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-movies-of-all-time5.png" class="imageright" alt="Best Movies of All Time" />
<p>We all prefer to enjoy the thrill and excitement of a movie, especially if we are immersed in it. Horror films are one such genre that transports us back to roller-coaster emotions. Let us emphasize straight now that Annabelle, an American supernatural horror film released in 2014, is unquestionably one of the best horror films of all time. </p>
<p>This film was based on a true story about a doll recounted by Ed and Lorraine Warren and was written and directed by John R. Leonetti. This narrative is divided into three parts, the first of which was released in 2014 as 'Annabella,' the second in 2017 as 'Annabella: Creation,' and the third in 2019 as 'Annabella Comes Home.' The first installment of this film depicts how a doll given by a husband to his expecting wife became possessed by a demon, and the couple had to overcome all obstacles to tackle the challenge and release the doll. It depicts a bunch of devil worshipers and cultists attacking a neighboring home, with the couple attempting to save them. </p>
<p>However, one of the cultists attempts to invoke a demon and drips blood on the doll, transforming it into absolute evil. Annabelle: Creation is the second section of the film, and it explains how Annabelle's narrative began. It recounts a couple's erroneous invitation of a demon after her daughter Annabelle's death, and the demon projected himself as Annabelle in order to escape in the doll created by the woman's spouse. The doll has been haunted since then and has been locked in their daughter's room with the help of a priest. After twelve years, the couple decides to help a sister and six orphan girls by allowing them to dwell in their home due to the orphanage's closure. Despite being advised not to unlock or enter their locked daughter's chamber, one orphan called Janice does so and becomes possessed. The rest of the story describes how the sister and other orphan girls tried to save themselves from the doll after learning the truth and were eventually saved. Janice, however, was still possessed and could not be saved, so she changed her name to Annabelle and went to another orphanage until being adopted by the Higgins family. This is how the second half of the story ties into the first when Annabelle murders her adopted parents, and a couple witnesses their neighbor being murdered and rushing to save them. As a result, this segment served as a precursor to the 2014 film Annabelle. The third act of Annabelle: Comes Home (2019) tells the narrative of the Demonologists couple and how the Annabelle doll ends up in their home after being reported for its violent activities. This section depicts how the Annabelle doll, which had been locked by the experts, was accidentally released, causing chaos, but that all of the characters involved put the doll back in its glass case and saved themselves.</p>
<h2 class="h2">6. Article 15</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-movies-of-all-time6.png" class="imageright" alt="Best Movies of All Time" />
<p>The key to living a happy life is to be aware. Our rights and responsibilities are derived from the constitution, but few people are aware of it, and few have allowed us to enjoy them since we are unaware of our rights. Article 15, released in 2019, is a film set in the Indian sociopolitical scenario that evokes the reality of the grassroots. It is a Hindi film directed by Anubhav Sinha and stars Ayushmann Khurrana as a police officer who examines the missing three girls from a rural village, revealing the caste-based crimes perpetrated against them. </p>
<p>The plot begins when Ayan Ranjan, a police inspector played by Ayushmann, arrives in the village of Laalgaon. The police officer becomes involved in the case of three missing girls, two of whom are later found hanging on a tree, and the third remains unidentified. The officer witnessed moral corruption and discrimination based on caste by the local police department. Later, he discovered that the girls had been gang-raped by the son of a local minister and two police officers. Despite being told by Brahmadatt Singh, a police officer and one of the rapists, that the girls were killed in an honor killing, Ayan discovered on his own, with the help of doctor Malti that they were gang-raped and murdered. </p>
<p>To protect the criminals, local authorities plotted against Ayan, and he was shortly suspended by a high-ranking CBI officer, Panikar. But Ayan refuses to give up, gathering all the evidence and handing it over to the Home Minister, saving the third girl, and with her statement, Brahmadutt is sentenced to eleven years in prison, while the son of the local minister is killed by Brahmadutt to save himself, and the other suspect, Nihal Singh, who happens to be close to Ayan, commits suicide out of guilt. The entire film critiques the upper class and castes' abuses against the Dalit population, and it demonstrates the supremacy of the constitution and its Article 15. </p>
<h2 class="h2">7. Hera Pheri</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-movies-of-all-time7.png" class="imageright" alt="Best Movies of All Time" />
<p>Hera Pheri is the type of film that will be passed down through the years in Indian movie history. Filmed by Priyadarshan and released in 2000, Hera Pheri is regarded as a classic Indian comedy movie among comedy lovers. The comedy movie is a Hindi version of <em>Ramji Rao Speaking,</em> a Malayalam film released in 1989 that was inspired by the 1971 television film See <em>The Man Run.</em> It has Paresh Rawal, Akshay Kumar, Sunil Shetty, and Tabu as lead actors. </p>
<p>The movie's plot is about Shyam (played by Sunil Shetty), Raju (played by Akshay Kumar), and Babu Rao (Paresh Rawal), who are just three regular guys, all of them in desperate need of money for their individual compulsions and how they find the opportunity of earning a huge sum in the form of a wrong phone call. Ghanshyam, nicknamed Shyam (Sunil Shetty), is a person trying to get a job in a bank as the plot starts. Despite the fact that his late father served there, he was denied the job. He runs into a man called Raju (played by Akshay Kumar in the film) by chance one day. Shyam mistook Raju for a thief and started chasing him down. Eventually, he learns the truth, and then Raju pursues Shyam after believing him for a pickpocket. Raju has his own problems, such as daydreaming and working for unpleasant individuals. He is unable to stay employed and consequently suffers numerous difficulties. Shyam then goes to a garage owned by Baburao Ganpatrao Apte (affectionately known as Babu Bhaiya) and negotiates a rental by conceding the cost of Babu Bhaiya's liquor.</p>
<p>Shyam is unaware that Raju is residing in the same place for rent that he hasn't paid in two years. Raju, now and then, instigates Shyam and purposely attempts to cause a scene in which Babu Bhaiya would settle. Anuradha Shivshankar Panikar (Tabu) appears during one of these fights and attempts to convince Shyam to accept the Non-Objection Certificate so that she can get the work at the bank. When Shyam denies signing the documents, Raju devises a scheme to force him to do so. Shyam ultimately discovers that Raju forced him to sign the papers under false pretenses, and the conflict between the two begins. Kharak Singh, played by Om Puri in the movie, an old acquaintance of Shyam's, visits him and asks for the money Shyam borrowed from him as credit. Kharak tells Shyam that unless he pays back the debt as quickly as possible, his sister's wedding will be annulled. Shyam discovers that Raju has been misleading his mother by pretending as an engineer.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Anuradha creates a letter of resignation and sends it to Shyam, who rips it apart after seeing Anuradha's mentally ill mother and the awful living conditions in her house. Afterward, he faces Raju, who expresses his desire to see his mother happy. Their lives take a dramatic route when they receive a phone call from Gangster Kabeera (played by Gulshan Grover) on a wrong number intended for Star Fisheries' owner, Mr. Devi Prasad (played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda). The incorrect phone number is due to a phone directory error, which wrongly prints Star Fisheries' number in place of Star Garage's and likewise. Kabeera, a terrorist and abductor, tells Devi Prasad that his grandchild Rinku has been abducted and demands a ransom. Raju plans something after listening to Kabeera and Shyam's whole exchange over the phone call. Shyam plays the game by impersonating the kidnapper and demanding double the ransom money, which will address their financial issues. Shyam and Babu Bhaiya firstly reject the proposal, but Raju persuades them that, even if it is immoral, this is a good opportunity to earn money while also saving a life. They contact the actual Deviprasad and demand a double ransom. They conceal their identity with helmets on their first try, but the police, commanded by Sub-Inspector Prakash (played by Mukesh Khanna) (who was called quietly by Devi Prasad's household help), stop their plan. Kabeera then notifies them that the extortion price has been increased by a factor of two. They contact Deviprasad once more, this time requesting a guaranteed twofold ransom. To cover their identity on the next occasion, they dress themselves as Zorro. They do, eventually, disclose themselves to Devi Prasad in order to gain his trust and save Rinku from the criminals. </p>
<p>However, she recognizes Shyam as a forger, alerting Kabeera. The policemen, Kabeera's gang members, and Kharak & his men, enraged by the delay in delivering the cash, engage in a massive brawl. The trio saves Rinku and returns her to Devi Prasad. Babu Bhaiya and Shyam return home happy, expecting to locate Raju with the cash, but they are unable to locate him. They call the cops to admit the offense, fearing Raju has deceived them. Raju, on the other hand, reappears and says that he had just gone to repay the creditors' money. When the cops show up, they notice the cash and detain the three. Finally, Devi Prasad defends the trio and persuades the policeman that all this was confusion, allowing them to return home wealthier than before. In the final scene, the trio receives a prank phone call from Devi Prasad's grandchild Rinku.</p>
<h2 class="h2">8. Slumdog Millionaire</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-movies-of-all-time8.png" class="imageright" alt="Best Movies of All Time" />
<p>Slumdog Millionaire is a 2008 British drama film based on Indian novelist Vikas Swarup's novel Q & A (2005). It tells the narrative of 18-year-old Jamal Malik from Mumbai's Juhu slums. The film went on to win 8 Academy and 7 BAFTA awards the following year. Jamal amazes everyone as a participant on Kaun Banega Crorepati, an Indian-Hindi edition of <em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</em> by answering every question right and winning $20 million. Jamal, who has been accused of cheating, tells the investigators about his whole journey, demonstrating how he has been capable of answering each question accurately. </p>
<p>This surrealistic story revolves around an incredibly determined and lovable youngster from Mumbai's garbage-strewn slums, whose exploits take him from the dismal deprivation of street begging to the massively successful game show stage. His journey provides a 360-degree vision of India's emergence as a country of remarkable contrasts, from teeming cities to the beautiful splendor of the Taj Mahal, from telemarketers' back rooms to the elevated apartments of Mumbai, where the industry is booming and generating a middle class clamoring for yet more. </p>
<p>The outcome is a fantastical voyage with a young child who retains his virtuousness and his belief in fate and affection throughout his adventures. Jamal (played by Ayush Mahesh Khedekar) is a seven-year-old Mumbai "slumdog" who lives alongside his Muslim mother and elder sibling, Salim (played by Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail), who is a natural hustler. They have a burst of power and like playing in the waste heaps that surround their run-down neighborhood. When he gets to secure the autograph of one of the Hindi cinema celebrities, it is a high milestone in his formative years; the way by which he achieves this accomplishment demonstrates his ingenuity and perseverance. His mom is ruthlessly murdered as anti-Muslim riots overwhelm their ghetto, which is a dark period in his early life. Jamal and Salim are stranded on the roads with no means and no faith. They pick up another orphan, Latika (played by Rubina Ali), with whom Jamal bonds right away. The Three Musketeers is how they see themselves. A black shadow descends upon their lives when these three children are kidnapped and taken to an illegal orphanage managed by a shady businessman who uses the children as beggars. He pushes some of them to pursue careers as singers before gouging out their eyes since blind children can earn double that of their peers. When Salim realizes they are in threat, he escorts Jamal and Latika away. The two lads jump into a passing train, but Latika fails to board the train and is apprehended. Jamal (Tanay Hemant Chheda) and Salim (Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala) acquire additional street smarts as teens by working as tourist guides at the Taj Mahal, inventing their own narrative of the monument's relevance. Jamal is determined to reunite with Latika (played by Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar), so they travel to Mumbai and discover her working in a brothel. Jamal (played by Dev Patel) goes on to work at a telemarketing agency as a "chai wallah," a guy who serves refreshments. </p>
<p>Salim (Madhur Mittal) gets a lucrative position as a criminal's bodyguard. Jamal meets Latika (Freida Pinto), a puppet for Salim's boss while visiting his brother. His objective is to audition for India's rendition of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" so that he can be with Latika, his sweetheart, at all times. The entire nation is looking as this devout young man successfully answers the questions and moves closer to the top reward of 20 million rupees. Prem (played by Anil Kapoor in the movie), the show's presenter, is first enamored with how this "Rags to Raja" tale is improving the viewership. However, he suspects Jamal of dishonesty and has him hauled to a police station to be grilled by the Police Investigator (Irrfan Khan). Jamal, an observant young guy, is incredibly inquisitive, and he keeps meticulous records of his experiences and lessons learned at each stage in life. Jamal is put to the trial time after time again, and in the course, he gains the fortitude, resilience, and conscience necessary to fix his views and make his strikes. He lets the loving spirit flow within him. From the first time he discovers Latika on a stormy day to the final scene in the movie, he never strays from his commitment to her. Jamal's life depends on intuition, and it helps him enormously when he has to make a critical decision on a televised contest. Ultimately, he exemplifies what it is to have a zeal for life that can help us get through the toughest periods when we just want to quit and forget about it all.</p>
