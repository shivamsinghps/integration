<h2 id="cultural" class="h2padding">List of cultural world heritage sites in India</h2>
<h2 id="TajMahal" class="h2">1) Taj Mahal, Agra</h2>
<p>It is located at the bank of river Yamuna in the city of Agra, Uttar Pradesh, and is one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It was <strong><em>built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan</em></strong> as a magnificent mausoleum in the memory of his wife Mumtaj Mahal who died in 1631. In <strong><em>1983, this site became a UNESCO world heritage site</em></strong>. Shah Jahan named it Taj Mahal to honour his wife Mumtaj Mahal.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/gk/images/unesco-world-heritage-sites-in-india.jpg" alt="UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India " />
<p>This monument is a splendid example of Mughal architecture that is a <strong><em>combination of Indian, Persian and Islamic architecture</em></strong>. Due to the beauty of its architecture, it is also known as the <strong><em>"Jewel of Muslim Art in India"</em></strong>. It is made of pure white marble decorated with semi-precious stones.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>construction</em></strong> of this monument started in <strong><em>1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD</em></strong>. So, it took around 16 years to complete this exquisite marble structure. Although thousands of artisan were involved in its construction, the <strong><em>Ustad-Ahmad Lahori</em></strong> was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="AgraFort" class="h2">2) Agra Fort, Agra</h2>
<p>It is located in the city of Agra, India, at a distance of 2.5 km from the Taj Mahal. It is one of the most important Mughal monuments commissioned by Mughal ruler <strong><em>Akbar in 1565 AD</em></strong>. It was the main residence of the Mughal rulers until 1683 before their capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. In <strong><em>1983, it was given the status of UNESCO World Heritage Site</em></strong>.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/gk/images/unesco-world-heritage-sites-in-india2.jpg" alt="UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India " />
<p>It is also famous as <strong><em>Red Fort of Agra</em></strong>. Before becoming Agra Fort, it was a brick monument namely <strong><em>Badalgarh</em></strong> as it was owned by a Hindu Rajput King Raja Badal Singh. Sikander Lodi was the first Sultan of Delhi who lived at this fort after the invasion.</p>
<p>The fort houses a number of monuments like Khas Mahal, Muhamman Burie, Diwan-e-Khas, Diwan-e-Am, Sheesh Mahal, Moti Masjid, Jahangir Palace and Musamman Burj where Shah Jahan died in 1666AD, and more.</p>
<p>It is a <strong><em>crescent-shaped fort</em></strong> that faces the river Yamuna on the east. Initially, this fort had four gates, two of which later closed or walled up. The gate through which visitors enter is called the <strong><em>Amar Singh gate</em></strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="AjantaCaves" class="h2">3) Ajanta Caves, Maharashtra</h2>
<p>Ajanta Caves are located 107 km from Aurangabad, Maharashtra. This site is a group or <strong><em>cluster of 32 rock-cut Buddhist caves</em></strong> with decorated sculptures and paintings related to the life of Buddha. It dates back to the <strong><em>2<sup>nd</sup> century BC to the 7<sup>th</sup> century (650) CE</em></strong>. Since <strong><em>1983</em></strong>, it is one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India. This site was <strong><em>discovered by a British Army Officer</em></strong> during British rule in India in <strong><em>1819</em></strong>.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/gk/images/unesco-world-heritage-sites-in-india3.jpg" alt="UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India " />
<p>Although these 30 caves are present at one place, they were built in two phases in two different time periods. First, it was built during the <strong><em>Satvahana Dynasty</em></strong> (230 BCE - 220 CE). Then few more structures were added to it or built during the Vakataka period under the reign of the ruler of the <strong><em>Vakataka Dynasty</em></strong>.</p>
<p>It is a perfect place to see the Buddhist culture and their lifestyle through paintings and sculptures. The basic architecture of the caves is known as 'Chaityagrihas' and 'Viharas'. The painting, sculptures and other structures were <strong><em>built by Buddhist monks</em></strong> by using simple tools such as a chisel, hammer, etc.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>main highlights</em></strong> of this place include sculptures of Buddha and acts or scenes from the traditional Jataka tales. It is a living example of ancient Indian art and is one of the best cave monuments in India.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="ElloraCaves" class="h2">4) Ellora Caves, Maharashtra</h2>
<p>It is one of the famous archaeological sites in India, located at a distance of 29 kilometres to the Northwest of Aurangabad, Maharashtra. In <strong><em>1983</em></strong>, it was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/gk/images/unesco-world-heritage-sites-in-india4.jpg" alt="UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India " />
<p>This ancient site comprises <strong><em>34 rock-cut temples and caves</em></strong> stretched over 2 kilometres, and carved from the cliff rock from 600 to 1000 AD. These caves and temples are an excellent example of Indian-rock cut architecture. This site provides an insight into the lives of people of those times. The presence of <strong><em>Jain, Buddhist and Hindu temples</em></strong> at this site shows the tolerance and friendliness among different faiths and beliefs in ancient India.</p>
<p>Apart from rock-cut temples, you can also see <strong><em>Charanandri Hills, Viharas and Maths</em></strong> built between the 5<sup>th</sup> and the 10<sup>th</sup> century.
