<h1 class="h1">List of Tiger Reserves in India</h1>
<p>Tiger is the most furious predator of the jungle, which is at the top of the food chain. So, its population is an indication of the health and existence of an ecosystem. If its population decrease, the entire ecosystem will be disturbed as there will be a tremendous increase in the population of animals that are hunted down by the tigers. So, in order to maintain the tigers' population, 'Project Tiger' was introduced by Govt. of India in 1973 to prevent the decreasing population of tigers. In this project, tiger reserves are established in different states of the country. A tiger reserve is an area that is specified by the govt. of India to provide protection to tigers and their prey on which they feed. All tiger reserves are governed by 'Project Tiger.'</p>
<p>The <strong><em>famous tiger reserves in India</em></strong> are described as follows:</p>
