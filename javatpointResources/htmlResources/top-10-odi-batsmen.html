<h1 class="h1">Top 10 ODI Batsmen</h1>
<p>The International Cricket Council currently has 12 full-time members, including representatives from India, Pakistan, England, South Africa, New Zealand, Afghanistan, Ireland, Bangladesh, Australia, Sri Lanka, West Indies, &amp; Zimbabwe. However, the ICC selects the top 10 players in each category each year based on the players' most recent performances. These rankings alter over time based on a player's performance in ODI matches.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the Top 10 ODI Batsmen:</strong></p>
<h2 class="h2">1. Mohammad Babar Azam</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-odi-batsmen1.png" alt="Top 10 ODI Batsmen" />
<p>Mohammad Babar Azam, born on October 15, 1994, plays for the Pakistan cricket team in international cricket and currently serves as captain of the squad in all formats. Babar became the player to attain this milestone the quickest, beating Hashim Amla's record of 83 innings in April 2021 while competing against South Africa in the debut ODI. In his 76th innings, he achieved it by scoring his 13th ODI hundred. He surpassed Virat Kohli, who'd already held the top slot for the last 1258 days, to emerge as the No. 1 ICC ODI batsman with 865 points at the conclusion of the competition.</p>
<p>Babar achieved his first T20I century (122) against South Africa on April 14, 2021, at the Centurion Stadium. His 197-run partnership with Mohammad Rizwan ranks fourth all-time in T20I partnerships and is the best partnership for Pakistan.</p>
<p>Babar reached 2,000 runs in T20Is in his 52nd innings on April 25, 2021, during the 3rd T20I against Zimbabwe, becoming the quickest batsman in terms of innings to accomplish so. Babar was chosen to lead Pakistan's team at the ICC Men's T-20 World Cup in September 2021. He reclaimed his ranking as the top T20I batter throughout the tournament. Babar set new records for the most fifties (four) and runs (303) scored in an ICC T20 World Cup. He captained Pakistan to the semi-finals when Australia defeated them, and their campaign was over.</p>
<h2 class="h2">2. Imam-ul-Haq</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-odi-batsmen2.png" alt="Top 10 ODI Batsmen" />
<p>Imam-ul-Haq plays for Pakistan's team in international cricket. He was born on December 22, 1995. He made history by becoming the second Pakistani batsman and the 13th to score a hundred on debut in an ODI against Sri Lanka. He was part of Pakistan's One Day International team in October 2017 for their tournament against Sri Lanka. On October 18, 2017, he played in his first ODI representing Pakistan against Sri Lanka. He went on to score his first ODI century and win the game's man of the match award. He followed Saleem Elahi as the second Pakistani batsman to get 100 in an ODI on his debut.</p>
<p>He set the biggest opening partnership in ODI history on July 20, 2018, in the 4th ODI against Zimbabwe, scoring 304 runs together. Pakistan reached their highest ODI total of 399 after losing just one wicket. Imam became the second-fastest batsman to reach 1,000 runs in ODIs in January 2019 during the 3rd ODI match against South Africa, doing it in his 19th innings. Imam made 151 runs in the 3rd ODI of the series against England before the Cricket World Cup. This marked the highest individual score by a Pakistani batsman in an ODI match against England. He attained his 2,000th ODI run in the third game against England in July 2021.</p>
<h2 class="h2">3. Rassie van der Dussen</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-odi-batsmen3.png" alt="Top 10 ODI Batsmen" />
<p>Rassie van der Dussen, a professional cricket player from South Africa, was born on February 7, 1989. In January 2019, during their match against Pakistan, he was a part of the South African ODI team. He participated in South Africa's debut ODI match against Pakistan on January 19, 2019. Van der Dussen made his ODI debut and came short seven runs of his first ODI century before being dismissed for 93. He scored an undefeated 80 at Kingsmead Stadium three days later. He scored 241 runs altogether, with an average of 120.5, throughout the five ODIs.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in March 2019, van der Dussen got retained for the ODI Tour match against Sri Lanka. Over the course of four ODIs, he scored 112 runs, with one fifty, and ended the campaign with an average of 56. Van der Dussen made his first ODI century against Pakistan in April 2021, finishing the game 123 not out. He also set a record for South Africa by scoring his maiden hundred in an ODI at the age of 32 years &amp; 54 days.</p>
<h2 class="h2">4. Quinton de Kock</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-odi-batsmen4.png" alt="Top 10 ODI Batsmen" />
<p>South African cricketer Quinton de Kock, former captain, was born on December 17, 1992. He now represents South Africa in limited-overs cricket. The first time De Kock played for South Africa against New Zealand at the T20 level was on December 21, 2012. The hosts quickly chased it down with eight wickets left after South Africa smashed New Zealand and had them all out for 86. He made an excellent first impression by batting an unbeaten 28 for 23 while chasing in his debut. He played his first One Day International for South Africa on 19 January 2013, in Paarl, South Africa, against New Zealand.</p>
<p>De Kock was chosen over Colin Ingram for South Africa's starting line-up against Pakistan in November 2013. De Kock scored his first ODI century in the 4th ODI in Abu Dhabi, scoring a match-winning 112 against 135 balls on such a difficult batting ground. South Africa triumphed 4-1 in the ODI series. De Kock's 128-run fifth ODI century against Sri Lanka helped South Africa win their first ODI series there. Also, he recorded his first test half-century in the series. He was included in the ICC's World ODI XI for his 2014 efforts. Additionally, the ICC and Cricinfo selected him as the ODI XI wicketkeeper in 2016.</p>
<p>De Kock and Hashim Amla established South Africa's highest-ever ODI run stand in the 2017 series against Bangladesh, scoring 282 runs together without losing a wicket. One-Day Internationals have never seen a higher partnership without any wickets falling than this one. He then scored his 15th ODI century and joined the top two South Africans to reach 5,000 ODI runs on February 4, 2020, while playing an at-home ODI series against England.</p>
<h2 class="h2">5. Jonny Bairstow</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-odi-batsmen5.png" alt="Top 10 ODI Batsmen" />
<p>English cricket player Jonathan Marc Bairstow, born on September 26, 1989, plays for the England cricket team in all formats worldwide. He plays in several Twenty20 leagues and represents Yorkshire in domestic cricket. When England faced Ireland in an ODI in August 2011, Bairstow was a part of the squad but was not selected to play. He made his debut the following month when he was chosen for the final ODI against India. He contributed by scoring an unbeaten 41 runs off with just 21 balls while playing as a professional batsman. He hit three sixes throughout his inning, among which the first came off the fifth ball he faced, earning him the title of Man of the Match.</p>
<p>In the 4th one-day international, he contributed to England's 4 -wicket victory over Pakistan by hitting 61 runs. The series was won by England 4-1, however, they lost the 5th ODI by four wickets despite Bairstow scoring 33. He played in the third one-day international against India and scored 56 runs as England scored 321/8, winning by five runs but dropping the series 2-1.</p>
<p>Bairstow scored his first ODI century on September 19, 2017, as he hit an unbeaten century against the West Indies team at Old Trafford. He made a one-day international record in 2018 by becoming the first English batsmen to score three consecutive hundreds. He was picked for the International ODI XI by the ICC and Cricinfo for his 2018 efforts. In July 2020, he played in all three of England's ODI matches against Ireland after being selected for the team. He also scored 88 runs.</p>

<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-odi-batsmen6.png" alt="Top 10 ODI Batsmen" />
<p>David Andrew Warner, an Australian cricketer who plays internationally, was a former vice-captain of the test squad and the twenty20 captain of his country. He was born on October 27, 1986. After 132 years without playing first-class cricket, he is the only left-handed opening batsman from Australia to be selected for a national team in any format. He is regarded as one of the best batsmen of our generation. The only Australian batsman to reach seven ODI hundreds in a single year is him.</p>
<p>Warner scored 163 from 157 balls to overcome Sri Lanka on 4th March 2012 in the first CB Series final at the Gabba. He continued to bat until the final pitch of the inning. His ODI century marked his first for Australia.</p>
<p>Warner became the fourth-fastest batsman in the world and the fastest Australian to reach 5000 runs in ODI on January 14, 2020, in the opening ODI match against India. He had a decent World Cup debut in 2015 by scoring 22 runs against England &amp; 34 runs against New Zealand. However, in their fourth game against Afghanistan, he hit 178 runs off 133 balls, breaking his previous ODI record, and helping Australia reach the greatest team total score in any World Cup &amp; the most in Australia. Warner finished the tournament with 345 runs for an average of 49.28, ranking him as the 11th-highest scorer.</p>
<p>He appeared in his 100th ODI on September 28, 2017, becoming the first Australian batsman and the eighth batsman overall to achieve a century in their 100th ODI. And since March 2022, Warner has accumulated 43 centuries in his career.</p>
<h2 class="h2">7. Virat Kohli</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-odi-batsmen7.png" alt="Top 10 ODI Batsmen" />
<p>Virat Kohli, the former captain of the Indian cricket team, was born on November 5, 1988. Generally recognized as among the greatest batters of all time. He was the very first batsman to occupy the top spot in the ICC ODI player rankings in 2013. During the 2014 and 2016 editions of the ICC World T-20, he twice received the Man of the Series award. In August 2008, Kohli travelled with the Indian ODI squad to Sri Lanka and to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy. During the ODI of that tour, he made his debut for his country just at the age of 19 and was out for 12 runs. He scored his maiden ODI half-century in the fourth game of the same series, posting a score of 54.</p>
<p>He was appointed vice-captain for the tri-series in Zimbabwe against Sri Lanka &amp; Zimbabwe. Kohli scored 168 runs at a 42.00 average, including two fifty-plus scores. Kohli made history by becoming the Indian batsman to score 1,000 ODI runs in the shortest time possible during the series. In the 2017th edition of the ICC Champions Trophy, Virat Kohli had the opportunity to serve as captain for the first time in an ICC competition. Kohli struck 96* against Bangladesh in the semi-final to achieve 8,000 runs in the ODI series in 175 innings, which is the fastest by any batsman in regard to innings.</p>
<p>He was picked to serve as the team captain for India at the 2019 Cricket World Cup, which was organized in April 2019. In the ODI match between India and Pakistan on June 16, 2019, Virat Kohli scored his 11,000th ODI run, making him the batsman to do it in the fewest number of innings.</p>
<p>He continued his strong play into the ICC Men's T-20 World Cup in 2022. Kohli hit 82* in the initial game against Pakistan, giving his team a narrow victory. Due to the importance of the game, he considered this to be one of his best games in the format. Kohli won the match with the most runs scored, 296 total, including 4 fifties. In the third ODI, he scored his 44th ODI century and 72nd overall, breaking Ricky Ponting's record for the second-most hundreds ever recorded in international cricket across all formats.</p>
<h2 class="h2">8. Rohit Sharma</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-odi-batsmen8.png" alt="Top 10 ODI Batsmen" />
<p>Rohit Gurunath Sharma, an Indian cricketer born on April 30, 1987, is the team's current captain. One of the best opening batters in history, according to many. Sharma is now the only player to have scored three double centuries in ODIs, holds the record for the most centuries (five) made in a single Cricket World Cup, and currently holds the record for the highest individual score (264) in an International ODI match.</p>
<p>On November 18, 2007, in a match against Pakistan, he reached his first ODI half-century (52). He made 235 runs in that series at an average of 33.57, including 2 fifties. However, his performance in ODIs declined after that, and Suresh Raina took his spot in the middle of the line-up.</p>
<p>He scored 114 in his maiden ODI on May 28, 2010, and then hit 101 not out in the tri-series encounter against Sri Lanka on May 30, 2010, to add another century to his tally. India's skipper Virat Kohli skipped the series against Sri Lanka to rest up for the team's tour to South Africa, which started in the initial week of January 2018. He was replaced as team captain by Sharma, and under his leadership, India won their ninth straight series, 2-1. Additionally, Sharma extended his record for the most One Day International double-centuries by a single player by scoring 208 (not out) in an ODI in December 2017. With 1,490 runs scored in ODIs over the year, including 7 centuries, he had the highest batting average in 2019.</p>
<p>The "ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Decade" award was presented to Sharma in November 2020. In July 2022, Sharma created history by being the first Indian team skipper to win an ODI &amp; T20I series in England. He became the first Indian captain since 2014 and the third overall to conquer an ODI series in England.</p>
<h2 class="h2">9. Ross Taylor</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-odi-batsmen9.png" alt="Top 10 ODI Batsmen" />
<p>Former international cricketer "Luteru Ross Poutoa Taylor," born on March 8, 1984, also served as captain of the New Zealand team. He was the top run-scorer for the New Zealand team in Test and ODI cricket before he declared his retirement from cricket at the completion of 2021, batting primarily at number four.</p>
<p>On February 18th, 2007, Taylor played against Australia and recorded his second ODI century. In the matchup between New Zealand and Australia, he scored 117, which was the second-highest score ever. During the opening Test of the 2007-2008 series against England in Mar 2008 at Hamilton, he reached his first Test century, and he went on to lead the series in runs scored.</p>
<p>When Daniel Vettori withdrew from the team less than 30 minutes prior to the start of the ODI against the Australian team in Napier on March 3, 2010, Taylor ended up leading the New Zealand team for the first time. With four balls remaining, New Zealand triumphed by two wickets thanks in large part to Taylor's best score of 70. Taylor was also awarded the "Man of the Match" honour.</p>
<p>During the ICC Cricket World Cup held on March 8, 2011, he scored 131*, his then-highest ODI total, against 124 balls against Pakistan. His innings, which featured seven sixes &amp; eight fours, helped New Zealand score 127 runs in the game's final nine overs to beat Pakistan (302) by their greatest total ever. With this hundred, Taylor joined Vinod Kambli, Sachin Tendulkar, &amp; Sanath Jayasuriya as the only other batsmen in the history of cricket to score an ODI century on their birthday.</p>
<p>Taylor's twelfth ODI 100 against Pakistan in Dubai. By scoring 93 runs while batting at 14* against India on January 28, 2019, Ross became the 3rd New Zealand batsman to reach 1000 runs in ODIs (106). With a game-winning 82, Taylor won his 400th international game for New Zealand. In addition, he outperformed Stephen Fleming in the same game to surpass him as New Zealand's leading ODI scorer. He became the second batter for New Zealand to reach 8000 ODI runs. Taylor announced his departure from international cricket on December 30, 2021. His retirement took effect at the conclusion of the summer of 2021/22.</p>

<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-odi-batsmen10.png" alt="Top 10 ODI Batsmen" />
<p>Former Australian national team captain and international cricketer Steven Peter Devereux Smith was born in Australia on June 2, 1989. Smith has been linked to Don Bradman, who is largely regarded as the best batsman to have ever lived because of his remarkably high test batting average. After being initially selected for Australia as a right-arm leg spinner, Smith primarily played as a batsman. Three ODI matches immediately followed the T20 series. Smith achieved his maiden ODI century in the opening ODI match at Sharjah Stadium, scoring 101 runs from 118 balls to give the visitors a 1-0 series lead. He scored 12 runs in the second ODI, and then he scored 77 runs from 105 balls in the third &amp; last ODI to win the ODI series by one run.</p>
<p>New Zealand played three One-Day Internationals (ODIs) between both the two-Test series; He played against Pakistan and South Africa; after the Test series, it played against South Africa. The first ODI saw Steve Smith hit 164 runs at the SCG, breaking AB De Villiers' previous record of 162 runs from the 2015 World Cup. This was the greatest ODI score ever at the venue. He received "Man of the match" honours. He scored 72 runs in the second ODI, and in the final ODI in Melbourne, he was out for a duck. The Chappell-Hadlee Trophy was won by the Australian team 3-0 and was given back to that country.</p>
<p>He was a member of Australia's team that competed in the 2019 edition of the Cricket World Cup in April of that year. Smith received a national contract from Cricket Australia for the 2019-20 campaign after sitting out the 2018-19 campaign. Smith participated in Australia's inaugural Cricket World Cup match against Afghanistan on June 1, 2019, at Bristol's County Ground. Smith hit 85 runs on July 11, 2019, in the semi-final game against England, becoming the second player after Sachin Tendulkar to record four 50-plus runs in a Cricket World Cup elimination game. He collected 379 runs over the competition at an average of 37.90, comprising four fifty-run innings. He lead Australia easily win the series by 3-0 in 2022 by scoring 195 runs in three games, including two half-centuries.</p>
