<h1 class="h1">List of Satellites launched by India</h1>
<p>An artificial object, a satellite, is a spacecraft that has been purposefully sent into orbit for a variety of reasons, including <strong><em>remote sensing, weather forecasting, picture mapping, educational purposes, and research.</em></strong></p>
<p>Satellites are defined as anything that circles another object in the same way as the Moon orbits the Earth. These satellites are used for a variety of tasks, including <strong><em>weather forecasting, television broadcasting, radio transmission, GPS navigation, and internet connectivity</em></strong>, among other things.</p>
<p>Since 1975, India has been effectively deploying a variety of different kinds of satellite systems. The <strong>India Space Research Organization (ISRO),</strong> which was established in <strong>1969,</strong> is often regarded as the country's only space research organization. The Indian Space Research Organization's headquarters are in Bangalore.</p>
<p>This list includes the vast majority of artificial satellites created and managed by the Republic of India, as well as some of its predecessor countries. Indian spacecraft of different varieties have been successfully launched since 1975. In addition to American, Russian, and European rockets, several spacecraft have also been deployed by Indian and other rockets sites from across the world. It is the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) that is in charge of the country's space program, and it is responsible for a large portion of the work involved in the design, construction, launch, and operation of the satellites.</p>
<p>Satellites are often classified into two categories:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Natural and,</li>
<li>Artificial</li>
</ul>
<p>Out there in orbit, there are a plethora of natural and manmade satellites, each of which performs a certain role while also making our life on the planet easier in one way or another. The artificial satellites, as the name implies, are spacecraft that have been built by humans and launched from various nations. Accordingly, we have listed satellites launched by India.</p>

<p>On <strong>February 28, 2021</strong>, the PSLV-C51 launch vehicle successfully launched Indian student satellites UNITYsat and Satish Dhawan SAT (SDSAT).</p>
<h3 class="h3">2021- GSLV F10/ Gisat 1</h3>
<p>The launch of the Geoimaging Satellite GISAT-1 (now known as the Earth Observation Satellite EOS-3) by the Geostationary Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV-F10) took place on <strong>August 12, 2021</strong>.</p>
<p>This was to be India's first state-of-the-art earth observation satellite, which would have been launched into a geosynchronous orbit around the planet. Instead, the satellite was destroyed.</p>
<p>Earth-observing satellite EOS-3 was designed to offer real-time imagery of wide portions of the planet, monitor natural catastrophe events and provide warnings in the event of such events, and observe cyclones, cloudbursts, thunderclouds, and other phenomena.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the first and second stages were successful, a technical malfunction prevented the Cryogenic Upper Stage from being ignited, and the mission was unable to be completed as planned.</p>
