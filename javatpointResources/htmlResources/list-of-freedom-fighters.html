<h1 class="h1">List of Freedom Fighters</h1>
<p>The independent India in which we live today would not have been the one if these Bravehearts had not fought the Britishers. There is a never-ending list of freedom fighters who fought for us. There are some who are known by everyone, but there are many whose names no one knows, and their contribution has never been recognized. These unsung heroes fought tirelessly against colonial rule, and many have paid the price of freedom by their lives, but they don't even have a mention in the history of India.</p>
<p>Let us give them a tribute by keeping them in our hearts forever and learn about some freedom fighters who had a major role in India's independence:</p>
<h3 class="h3">1. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</h3>

<p>Tirot Singh, also known as U Tirot Singh, was one of the pioneers of northeast India who started a war against British rule. He opposed British rule in the Khasi hills. But unfortunately, his name is not known by many. In fact, 90% of Indians don't even know his name. He is one of the brave unsung heroes of north-eastern India. He opposed colonial rule at a time when people were not even aware of the consequences of British rule. He kept them away for four years before he was finally captured in 1833.</p>
<h3 class="h3">5. Tantia Tope</h3>

Shastri Ji became the second Indian prime minister in the period 1964-1966. Unfortunately, in1966, during a visit to Tashkent, he died.

He resigned from ICS in 1921 to participate in the Non-cooperation movement. Leader of <strong>'Azad Hind Fauj',</strong> Bose, coordinated with Nehru for the formation of the <strong>Independence League</strong> of Youth, which was formed under the congress. He gave the famous battle cry <strong>"Chalo Dilli".</strong> It is said that Bose died in 1945 in a plane crash in Taiwan, but many claims that he was not present in that plane during the crash. To date, there is no death certificate issued in the name of Subhash Chandra Bose, and the plane crash which occurred in Taiwan has not been registered anywhere. Netaji's ashes are preserved in a temple located in Tokyo (Japan). Despite various requests for a DNA test of the ashes kept in the temple, which will reveal the truth behind the death, the government has not conducted any test. If Netaji were alive, India perhaps would be many years ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Swatanta Veer Savarkar</strong> was born on 28th May 1883 in Bhagur (a small town in Nashik, Maharashtra). He was a Chitpavan Brahmin from Maharashtra, but he didn't think <strong>Hinduism</strong> was a religion; instead, he believed Hinduism is a geographical and cultural identity. According to him, Hinduism is the way of life, and religion is a western concept. He opened a temple in Maharashtra where people of every caste were welcome. He was a poet and wrote many poems and books. He was the first to realize that the 1857 uprising was not a mutiny, and he was the first who demanded <strong>Poorna Swaraj</strong> (Complete Independence). He excelled in his studies and even got a scholarship to study in London. He wrote the book titled <strong>'The Indian War of Independence 1857';</strong> this book became the guide for many revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Subhash Chandra Bose, and many others.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Even after 74 years after independence, we don't have any official list that displays the freedom fighters' names. Thousands of people sacrificed their lives to free India from British control. In many articles, newspapers, magazines, and other texts, it is mentioned that India is a country that gained its independence through Ahimsa, i.e., non-violence, but the reality is extremely opposite. When Poorna Swaraj was demanded, many organizations were formed which had many revolutionaries, and they were led by leaders like Ram Prasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Subhash Chandra Bose, and many others. India house was one of the organizations which were established in London. Their main motto was to free Indians from British colonial rule and make India an independent nation through arm rebellion if necessary.</p>
