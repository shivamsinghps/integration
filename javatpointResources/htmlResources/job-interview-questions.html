<p>At the time of answering this question, you should choose a story containing not too many mistakes. It should be real.</p>
<p>Talk about the mistake, but it is also important to convince the interviewer that you never make the same mistake again.</p>
<p><b>For example:</b></p>
<blockquote><p>I think the worst mistake I ever made at work was in my first ever job - five years ago now. A more senior member of the team seemed to take an instant dislike to me from the start, and one day she was particularly unpleasant to me in front of several colleagues. </p>
<p>Later on, I was talking to one of those colleagues who was, I thought, attempting to console me. Angry and hurt, I foolishly vented my feelings and told her what I thought of the lady in question. I was naturally shocked to find out that she went on to tell everyone what I had said and this certainly didn't help my relationship with the team member who was causing me problems. </p>
<p>Rather than let the situation carry on, I chose to have a quiet word with this lady to find out what her problem was with me and to see if we could put it behind us. It turned out it was nothing personal; she just resented the fact that a friend of hers had also been interviewed for my position and had been turned down. Once we had got matters out into the air, her behavior changed, and we got on quite well after that. However, I certainly learned a lot from experience. I learned that careful communication is vital in managing interpersonal relationships and that if I have a problem with someone, it's always best to talk it over with them rather than with someone else.</p> </blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">36) Do you have any reference? </h3>

<p><strong>Possible Answer 2</strong></p>
<blockquote>I would ask the customer to explain his problem and carefully listen to him. After that, I do my best to solve his problem. If that problem is not regarding my work area, I spoke to someone who could help him immediately.</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">38) How do you deal with an angry or irritated customer?</h3>
<p><strong>Possible Answer 1</strong></p>
<blockquote>I would try to find out exactly what the problem was, and evaluate if there was something I could do to make it right.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Possible Answer 2</strong></p>
<blockquote>I would ask the customer to explain his problem and carefully listen to him. After that, I do my best to solve his problem. If that problem is not regarding my work area, I spoke to someone who could help him immediately.</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3"> 39) What is your greatest fear?</h3>
<p><strong>Possible Answer 1</strong></p>
<blockquote>Before some time, public speaking has been a challenge for me. I was very nervous and hesitate while giving any presentation, so I started taking public speaking seminars to improve it. Now, I still get nervous before pitches, but I have learned how to remain calm and get the job done right. </blockquote>
<p><strong>Possible Answer 2</strong></p>
<blockquote>As you know that I have never worked in my life and this is my first job, my inexperience is my weakness. But I beg to differ. I am confident and a fast learner. I assure you that I will perform my job without carrying any pre-conceived notions regarding how I feel. </blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">40) Explain the difference between group and team?</h3>
<p>The difference between group and team are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>There is only one difference between the group and the team. That is unity. Any set of people who stand together without any purpose or goal can be called as Group. Whereas, when more than 2 people work towards a common goal, can be called as a Team. For example: If you assign work to a group, then the work will be divided between the members and each member will work out their part, without any coordination with the other members of the group. On the other hand, if you assign a project to a team, they will collectively take the responsibility and work together with the goal to achieve the desired result. In a team, the members will cooperate and coordinate with each other at all times.</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">41) What will you do if you don't get this position?</h3>
<p><strong>Possible Answer 1</strong></p>
<blockquote>I have high hopes that I will be selected. In case if I will not select, I will continue to look for another job in the same field that will fit my schedule and goals. </blockquote>

<blockquote> If I don't get this job, I will use this experience to reflect my weakness and try my best to improve on them for the future opportunities along the way.</blockquote>
<hr />

<hr />
<h3 class="h3">43) Would you like to relocate or travel for the company?</h3>
<p>Firstly, you need to understand the purpose of this question. The fresher candidate does not say <em>YES</em> at once. This will only show your desperation to this job. You can answer like this: </p>
<p><strong>Possible Answer 1</strong></p>
<blockquote> I will definitely consider traveling if the opportunity is appropriate, rewarding and feasible. I don't think that I will have any problem with the traveling involved. </blockquote>
<p><strong>Possible Answer 2</strong></p>
<blockquote>Yes, as part of growing up. I used to travel a lot as my father is an ex-serviceman hence occasionally he used to be posted throughout the country. Though I would prefer my city as it is my birthplace and all my friends and relatives are there, but at the same time, I am ok with relocating.</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">44) What makes you happy?</h3>
<p>I feel happy when I accomplished my task. I also feel happy when I achieved my goals. Holiday with my family and friends also makes me happy.</p>
<hr />

<p>It is good to start with a disclaimer that you are not aware of the strengths of the other candidate. Also, you sure that some impressive candidates apply for this position. </p>
<p><strong>Possible Answer 1</strong></p>
<blockquote>Although, I am not familiar with the others whom you are interviewing for this position. I am sure many talented people applying for the job. But because of my background and the problem-solving skills, I considered myself to be a strong candidate for this position.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Possible Answer 2</strong></p>
<blockquote>I understand that success is not always guaranteed but there is still hope, and I never lose the faith, whether I succeed or not. I think this power makes me stand alone from all other candidates.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Possible Answer 3</strong></p>
<blockquote>I have exceptional organizational skills. In my last job, I created a project which was termed as quite creative by the clients. I think my technical skills make me stand alone from all other candidates.</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">46) Describe the three things that are most important for you in a job?</h3>

<blockquote>According to me, Honesty, Loyalty, and determination to achieve my team's target are the three important things in a job.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Possible Answer 2</strong></p>
<blockquote>According to me, Professionalism, growth and a healthy work-life balance are the three important things in a job.</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">47) What are your expectations from the company?</h3>
<p>Though this answer is objective and can be different for different persons, but you should be positive in your thoughts and do not say many things about the company which gives the interviewer an illusion that you are exaggerating. In short, be realistic and precise.</p>
<p><strong>For Example </strong></p>

But I'll give you 9/10 as there should always be a scope to increase our skills which will create an interest in learning the things. Thank you very much for giving me this wonderful opportunity.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Possible Answer 2</strong></p>
<blockquote>Thank you for giving me such an opportunity, but for sure I am not the person to rate you. As it is obvious that your position is highly reputed and you have been chosen to undergo this process that shows your excellence at this place, but still I have to answer this question so honestly, it would be 9/10 as no one is perfect and we always leave room for improvement.</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3"> 49) Who is your role model? What have you incorporated into your life from him/her?</h3>
<p>You should think of people who embody the qualities that you most admire. </p>
<p><strong>For Example </strong></p>
<blockquote>The role model of my life is my mother. Whenever I am down my mother helps me to push my limits, and she always keeps me on the track. She was scolding me whenever I do something wrong. She is everything for me, I still got inspired from her, how she manages every problem in every situation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thank you for giving me this opportunity. After my overall performance till now if I got selected what I need to improve and if I'm not selected how can I succeed further. Can you give any advice sir?</blockquote>
