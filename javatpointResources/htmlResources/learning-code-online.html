<li>To earn more money using coding skills and become a more successful coder in the future, one should learn code and enhance creativity, logic building, and problem-solving skills.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">How do we learn to code online?</h3>
<p>As we all know, there is a certain procedure that we require to follow step by step for each start.</p>
<p>Here we look upon the procedure of how one can learn code online and by using online platforms -</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Select any of the programming languages.</li>
<li>Go through with the <strong>Fundamental concepts</strong> of the chosen language</li>
<li>Enrol yourself on the various online coding platforms</li>
<li>Gradually move towards an advanced level and go through with the concept of Data Structures and algorithms.</li>
<li>Work on projects</li>
<li>Stay updated and explore more.</li>
</ol>
<p>If anyone wants to become a good coder and enhance their problem-solving, logic-building, and presentation skills, one should follow the procedural steps written below.</p>
<p>Let us see in detail about these steps one by one -</p>
<h3 class="h3">1. Select any of the programming languages:</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/blog/images/learning-code-online2.png" alt="Learning code online" />
<p>This step is a primary and very difficult step that one should choose for them. The two cases arise after choosing any programming language, i.e., If you have chosen a programming language in which your interest increases day by day during your learning. You are very comfortable in it, then you will easily grab that programming language, and simultaneously your problem-solving and logic building skills also increase. But if you have chosen a programming language that you cannot understand quickly and are not much comfortable in, it will ultimately waste your time. If you put more effort into it, still you will not be able to get the desired output.</p>
<p>Also, do not choose more than one programming language at the same time, it will ultimately increase your difficulty, and you will not be able to become experts in one of the languages. So pick one at a time and start learning to code form that programming language itself.</p>
<p><strong>List of programming languages one should choose to learn to code -</strong></p>
<h3 class="h4">Python</h3>
<p><a href="python-tutorial.html">Python</a> is one of the famous and easiest programming languages. Its syntax is quite simple and easy to learn, but it also has greater applications, and it is used in various fields and has a great scope in today's programming world. Python is the most popular programming language for learning machine learning and data science due to it has lots of popular machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn and <a href="python-pandas.html">Pandas</a>. Anyone in future wants to pursue a career in <a href="data-science.html">data science</a> and <a href="machine-learning.html">machine learning</a>, and one should choose python.</p>
<p>Also, it has other applications, like it is widely used for web development due to its famous high-level web frameworks, i.e., <a href="django-tutorial.html">Django</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h4">Java</h3>
<p><a href="java-tutorial.html">Java</a> has been another most popular programming language for a long time. It stills remain at the top and one of the most widely used programming language and in demand. It has greater application in <strong>web development, app development, Android development</strong> and <strong>big data.</strong> Java offers strong memory allocation and high performance.</p>
<p>Java is also used on the back-end and for sites like Twitter, Google, Amazon, etc.</p>
<h3 class="h4">C</h3>
<p><a href="c-programming-language-tutorial.html">C</a> is one of the <strong>oldest, widely used,</strong> and <strong>fastest</strong> programming languages; it is most popular for enhancing our basics, and it helps to strengthen our fundamental concepts of coding. C forms the foundation for other most popular programming languages like <strong>C#, java,</strong> and <strong>JavaScript.</strong></p>
<p>C programming language plays a huge role in game development, virtual reality and computer graphics. As we talk about today's scenario, all the big companies take the interview especially based on the C and C++ skills. According to them, the actual programmer is the programmer who knows C and C++ concepts.</p>
<h3 class="h4">C++</h3>
<p><a href="cpp-tutorial.html">C++</a> is an extended version of C. C++ is also widely used, and it focuses on the OOPs concept (Object-Oriented programming ). It has a quite simple syntax as compared to C.</p>
<p>C++ programming language also plays a huge role in game development, virtual reality and computer graphics. </p>
<h3 class="h4">JavaScript</h3>
<p><a href="javascript-tutorial.html">JavaScript</a> is especially used for Web development and most widely used programming language. It is considered as a <strong>standard programming language</strong> of the Internet.</p>
<p>JavaScript is used in both back-end and front-end web development to add dynamic functionalities to websites.</p>
<h3 class="h4">C#</h3>
<p><a href="c-sharp-tutorial.html">C#</a> is pronounced as <strong>C sharp</strong>, not as C hashtag. It is a <strong>multi-paradigm programming language</strong> that has very strong features. Some of the features are <strong>declarative, imperative, functional, generic, object-oriented</strong> and <strong>component-oriented disciplines</strong>. It is widely used to develop a wide range of software applications. It is used by senior .net web developers, automation test engineers and software engineers.</p>
<p>C# is the most popular and helps developers create XML web services, and Microsoft .net connected Internet and Windows Operating systems applications.</p>
<p>The programming languages, as mentioned above, are the languages that are widely used and help develop our problem-solving skills, coding skills and logic building skills. These programming languages helps a person to become a good coder, programmer and also helps to grab an ' A ' grade job in future.</p>
<p>If someone wants to become a web developer and pursue their career in web development, they must know the below-mentioned languages, i.e., <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS.</strong> However, HTML and CSS is not a programming language, but it is a basic language that forms the skeleton part for websites. Without basic knowledge about the syntax and use of HTML and CSS language, one cannot construct web pages because it forms the foundation for making web pages. It forms the foundation for web pages and is necessary for development.</p>
<h3 class="h4">HTML</h3>
<p><a href="html-tutorial.html">HTML</a> stands for <strong>Hyper-Text Markup Language</strong> is widely used to develop and describe the structure of web pages. It is used for structural purposes on a web page; it is not used for functional purposes on the web pages, and it does not disturb the dynamic behaviour of a web page.</p>
<h3 class="h4">CSS</h3>
<p><a href="css-tutorial.html">CSS</a> stands for <strong>Cascaded Style Sheet</strong>, used to define the styles of our webpages; it all depends on the web developer what style or look they want to give to their webpages. It is used for describing the presentation of a document written in a Markup language such as HTML.</p>
<h3 class="h3">2. Go through with the Fundamental concept of the chosen language.</h3>
<p>After selecting a particular programming language, you all need to understand the fundamentals and start learning the basics of the chosen language. Never skip this fundamental step because most of the beginners focus on the higher technology and advanced concepts, without understanding basic functionalities properly. If further creates the problem for them in future.</p>
<p>Remember that if we are strong in basics, we can easily enjoy learning any programming language and properly understand it. However, nobody can secure mastery in any programming language and cannot learn about all the libraries and frameworks of that language. But yes, when you need a particular library and framework, you need to understand that particular library properly. If you have your strong basics, you can easily grab all the concepts of that particular library.</p>
<p>To learn about the fundamental concepts of a programming language, follow the steps given below -</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>First of all, mark all the fundamental concepts on a paper that you require to learn further.</li>
<li>For learning all the marked fundamental concepts of that language, either refer to any famous book that the experienced programmer writes. Remember that the book you have chosen must cover all the basic concepts of that language; also, see the pattern used by that book, whether it has included all the examples and explanations in it.</li>
<li>If you find difficulty learning from a book, you can refer to famous tutorials such as <strong><u>JavaTpoint</u>, <u>W3school,</u> <u>GeeksforGeeks</u>, <u>Stackoverflow</u></strong>, etc. In these tutorials, you will easily find all the necessary details, along with examples and explanations of each concept.</li>
<li>Also, you can join the online forums that provide training courses like <strong>Coursera, Udemy, Edx, IBM Skills Build, Udacity,</strong></li>
<li>After choosing a proper platform for learning, adopt a proper strategy of learning. Make a weekly or monthly timetable; it depends on you, and set a proper time for learning a programming language from your busy daily schedule. Follow the timetable properly with honesty.</li>
<li>Always maintain consistency, make at least two or three programs in a day, try to not leave a break in between. Start with the small programs always and then move towards the complex ones. If you are stuck somewhere, you can learn from the above tutorials or visit the various YouTube channels at your convenience.</li>
<li>As we all know, we cannot learn these languages in one day, do not be in a hurry, take time and try to learn gradually; definitely, you will succeed in your learning.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that always focus on a single programming language at a time, never confuse with other programming languages during your learning period of a particular programming language. Sometimes this confusion arises difficulties in your learning of a particular programming language, and you will never be able to make a command over a particular chosen programming language.</p>
<h3 class="h3">3. Enrol yourself on the various online coding platforms</h3>
<p>After learning about the fundamental concepts of the chosen programming language, try to enrol yourself on the various online coding challenging platforms and websites.</p>
<p>As we all are familiar with the quote " practice makes a person perfect "; hence, we require more practice to become an expert in problem-solving and build the logic to solve a problem in the chosen programming language very quickly. It will only happen when we enrol ourselves on the various coding challenging platforms and websites.</p>
<p>These challenging coding platforms will enhance our <strong>problem-solving skills</strong> and <strong>logic building skills.</strong> It teaches us to solve a particular problem along with the logic building in a particular duration. I would recommend the best way of practising that, whenever you have completed a particular topic of the fundamentals of the chosen programming language, then simultaneously solve all the practice problems of that topic from various coding challenging platforms. Remember, do not be in too much hurry; gradually learn all the programming language concepts.</p>
<p>List of various free online coding challenging platforms -</p>
<p>There are many free online coding challenging platforms and websites available on which you can enrol yourself at any time and from anywhere.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>HackerRank -</strong> HackerRank is an online coding challenging platform where many programmers from all over the world come together to solve a problem.

<h3 class="h3">4. Gradually move towards an advanced level and go through with the concept of Data Structures and algorithms.</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/blog/images/learning-code-online8.png" alt="Learning code online" />
<p>After enrolling yourself on various coding challenging platforms, improve your fundamental concepts of the chosen programming language; once you are satisfied, you can move further and want to enhance your knowledge more in the field of programming, and more you will learn to do coding efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>Start with the Data Structure and Algorithm because it is the <strong>heart of programming.</strong> Every programmer must know all the concepts of data structure and algorithm on tips. Without the knowledge of data structure and algorithm, nobody can be called a programmer. Your problem-solving skills will only be enhanced using data structure and algorithm concepts at a higher level.</p>
<p>There are some important points mentioned below, which play a very important role in learning codding, and it helps us get more advanced in the field of programming by using the concepts of data structure and algorithm.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>First of all, you need to understand it step by step, by satisfactorily understanding a particular topic of <strong>data structure</strong> and <strong>algorithm</strong> and then trying to solve various problems. The strategy you require to solve a problem, i.e., initially read a given problem carefully and properly, try to understand it, and then decide which algorithm is best suited for the given problem or which approach you must follow to solve the given problem.</li>
<li><strong>Problem-solving</strong> is nothing without Data Structure and Algorithms, and one should gradually learn all the concepts of the data structure and algorithm. Data Structure and Algorithm in the heart of programming. If you want to raise your level and wants to become a good programmer, learn data structure and algorithm daily, do not leave it in between, because once you leave it in between, you need to revise it again from the starting until you reach to the part where you left. Better you will cover it in a particular duration without any break. Also, after completing once, try to solve a maximum number of competitive problems and enhance your problem-solving skills.</li>
<li>For learning the data structure and algorithm, you can refer <strong>JavaTpoint tutorials</strong>, which provides you with all the concepts of data structure and algorithm by covering all the topics gradually.</li>
<li>Data structure and algorithms are a very wide concept, do not try to consume in one stroke or say in one go. Do not think that anyhow you need to complete it in 10 days or more. Give itself a <strong>proper time</strong> to understand it properly without any confusion and ambiguity.</li>
<li>Pick a topic, complete it gradually by understanding all concepts, and then solve various questions from the above-mentioned online websites and platforms, i.e., <strong>HackerRank, CodeChef, Leetcode, HackerEarth TopCoder,</strong></li>
<li>After then pick the next topic, follow the same procedure which is described above. While learning a new topic, kindly practice the competitive programming questions of the previous topics so that you won't find any difficulty in the new topic and can easily link the new topic with the previous one.</li>
<li>Whenever you are stuck on a complex problem and unable to find the way of coming out from it, then you all need to apply a simple and very effective and efficient strategy, i.e., Divide the complex problem into <strong>smaller problems</strong> or can say small chunks, divide it until you reach to the endpoint or can say that the problem is further divisible. After dividing, try to find the solution of a small part; once you find it, apply it to the other subproblems and combine it to get the final result and desired output.</li>
<li>Again continuously, the only thing that determines your success is practice, practice and practice; the more you practice, the more you will be reduced. Try to participate in competitive programming and solve the daily challenges of the various programming problems to enhance your problem-solving skills.</li>
<li>After learning the basics of the data structure and algorithm concepts, research various <strong>applications</strong> and <strong>implementation</strong> of data structure and algorithms. For example, In the round-robin algorithm, in web applications, you will find a lot of use of arrays and strings; in the operating system, you will find the use of stack and queue; also, the greatest application of stack is the tower of Hanoi and in recursion.</li>
<li>After then, try to implement your learning on a practical basis by building few applications using data structure and algorithm concepts. Also, if you want to get a job in your dream company, you need to know the concepts of data structure and algorithm very well and their implementation. Try to solve various interview questions as well.</li>
<li>Try to rate yourself and focus on your weaknesses.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">5. Work on projects</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/blog/images/learning-code-online9.png" alt="Learning code online" />
<p>After learning about data structure and algorithm concepts and having a command over any particular programming language, start working on some <strong>application-related projects</strong>.</p>
<p>Projects can be a testing end for us, once we have learned all the concepts thoroughly and want to check whether we have learned correct or whatever we have learned is worthy for us, or can say our learning produces desired outcomes and results or not.</p>
<p>A project is a unique and transient endeavour to achieve planned aims and objectives, defining outcomes, results, or desired output. It is usually deemed a success if it achieves the objectives according to their input and acceptance criteria in particular time duration.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>When we come to this project making state, it is a great way towards success. Projects are enhanced not only our problem-solving skills and logic building skills but also developed our self-confidence towards our learning.</li>
<li>Participation in these various <strong>Technical hackathons</strong> is not only meant to submit our names to the coordinators. It means that we are challenging other competitors with that spirit and can assure the winning chances against them.</li>
<li>At the initial level, try to build a small project using the coding language, which you have made great command over it.</li>
<li>Never be demotivated if somehow you cannot complete a project on time or decide which method and techniques you need to implement in that project. Always open your notes, revise it from starting, then try to build that project again; once a day, you will succeed in building a project.</li>
<li>After building your first project, you will observe that you are more comfortable with your chosen programming language and much familiar with it. Now chose another small project but tried to choose different from the previous one, and it is not much simpler than the previous one. Gradually move towards a higher level and start working on your next small project.</li>
<li>Once you have to take command of building small projects, gradually start moving towards big projects having more complexities in them and along with completion, try to complete it in less time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">6. Stay updated and explore more.</h3>
<p>Explore more and more as much you can do in computer science and technology; the more you will explore, the more you can connect yourself with the world of programming. Research various fascinating ideas and projects related to your skills and learning.</p>
<p>The steps mentioned above are necessary for someone who wants to become a good programmer and learn coding online by using various online platforms that connect you with the real programming world.</p>
