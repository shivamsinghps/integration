After almost eight years, Lieutenant James Norrington is promoted to commodore and he proposes to Elizabeth.

During this time, Captain Jack Sparrow had just arrived at the Port Royal to commandeer a ship. Seeing Elizabeth fall, he dives in to rescue her. Norrington recognizes Jack as a Pirate and so the chase begins.</p>

The same night, Port Royal gets attacked by the crew of The Black Pearl who was in search of the medallion. They capture Elizabeth and take her to meet Captain Barbossa. She conceals her identity as the governor's daughter and changes her last name to Turner. Barbossa narrates her the story about the medallion being one of 882 gold pieces that his crew stole from a treasure on Isla De Muerta, resulting in a curse being placed on Barbossa and his crew and turning them into immortals. Barbossa had returned all the pieces of the treasure except this medallion. Believing Elizabeth to be the daughter of William Turner (Bootstrap Bill), he takes her as his prisoner as he needs the Turner blood to lift the curse.</p>
<p>Back in Port Royal, Will asks for Jack's help to rescue Elizabeth, whom he loves. Jack, who was the previous Captain of The Black Pearl, makes a deal with Will to retrieve his ship. The two then commandeer HMS Interceptor and head for Tortuga with a crew. As they chase the Black Pearl, they witness Barbossa sacrificing Elizabeth's blood and returning the final piece of gold to the treasure. The curse does not break as Elizabeth is not the daughter of William Turner who was actually the father of Will turner. He was thrown overboard for giving the medallion to Will.

While Elizabeth escapes the Dauntless and frees Jack's crew from the brig of the Black Pearl, Jack switches sides again and frees Will. Will and Elizabeth fight off Barbossa's crew. While the dueling between Jack and Barbossa goes on he stabs Jack, but it turns out that Jack had stolen a piece of gold from the treasure which meant that even he was under the curse.</p>
<p>Jack shoots Barbossa and Will returns the gold pieces to the chest with his and Jack's blood on it. The curse is lifted, and Barbossa dies because of Jack's gunshot. The rest of Barbossa's crew surrender comprehending that they are no longer immortals. On reaching Port Royal, Jack is taken to the Gibbet for piracy.

The ship is seen to be sailing towards the Devil's Triangle when it stumbles upon the ghostly crew of Silent Mary, which is commanded by the former British commander Captain Armando Salazar, who was a pirate hunter. All the crew/sailors of the Monarch are killed except Henry who is spared to take a message to Jack about his vengeance. Salazar and his crew were trapped in the Devil's Triangle by Jack. The compass that Jack possesses is what holds them in the Devil's Triangle.</p>

She escapes and crosses paths with Jack who is seen to be stealing money from the bank. After a brief conversation, they both escape. Jack whose crew members abandoned him had nothing left with him, so he trades the compass for a bottle of Rum. As the exchange of the compass happens Salazar and his crew are set free from the devil's triangle.

Meanwhile, Jack annoys Salazar with the taunts that he had used during trapping Salazar in the devil's triangle. An extremely annoyed Salazar makes a leap towards Jack and stabs him with the trident in his chest. Luckily a book which was positioned near his chest saved Jack and he asks Henry to help him. Henry grabs his sword and with a swift blow sends the trident crashing it into two pieces, thus breaking all curses of the sea.</p>
<p>As the curse breaks, Salazar and his crewmates are turned back into mortals.
