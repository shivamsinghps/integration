<p>Social media apps are very common today. There are different types of social media applications available, and the users choose them based on their requirements. Every day hundreds of new social media apps and websites are launched, which have some new and innovative features, and they try to make their reach more to the users. To understand different social media applications, let us understand the term social media. <strong>Social media refers to any computer-based service that allows users to create, share or access content through a virtual network</strong>.</p>
<p>There are innumerable social media apps available that have different features, and choosing the right application that fulfills our need is a major task and sticking to a particular app is much more difficult. Social media provides a great opportunity to explore new things, and some apps also help us to expand our business and introduce our product to millions of other users of the app. With the help of social media, one can connect with individuals who share a common interest and can get rid of boredom. Many use social media to show their talents to other people. Such kinds of people are known as <strong>content creators</strong>, and the people who use the applications to entertain themselves or learn some skills are known as <strong>content consumers</strong>. Nowadays, many people are attracted to social media to introduce their business to the people, so many applications have made a separate business-friendly interface so that the companies can directly get connected with their customers and provide them better services and also collect their feedback to improve their products and services.</p>
<p>Many companies collaborate with social media networks so that they can get aware of what the customers want from the company. Companies collect reviews and feedbacks from various people, and the data is used for improving the products and services of the particular company. Many companies nowadays prefer social media instead of television for advertising their product or service as advertising on social media is cheaper than advertising on television, and most importantly, on social media, companies can target the customers who are interested in their product/service. Many social media applications are designed in such a way that they only show the advertisements that the user might be interested in. Here is a list of the <strong><em>12 most popular social media applications</em></strong>.</p>
