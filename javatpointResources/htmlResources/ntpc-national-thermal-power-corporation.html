<h2 class="h2">NTPC limited: History</h2>
<p>The history of NTPC limited is very long and vast, and we cannot study it in a single-phase manner as many changes have been seen in past decades. Therefore, we are going to study the history of NTPC limited in various phases in this section.We will discuss the history of NTPC limited in the following three parts in this section:</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Early beginning (1975 to 1994)</li>
<li>New Changes (1995 to 2004)</li>
<li>Current Scenario (2005 to Present)</li>
</ol>
<p>We will discuss each phase included in the history of NTPC limited and see what major changes have come in each of the three phases, as we have mentioned above.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Phase 1: Early beginning of NTPC limited (from 1975 to 1994):</h3>
<p>NTPC limited was founded as National Thermal Power Corporation Private Limited on November 7th of 1975, and it became operational in 1976 by starting work on its first thermal power project at Shakti Nagar of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in the year 1976. The first thermal power project of NTPC limited was named National Thermal Power Corporation Private Limited Singrauli. Also, in the year 1976, the name of NTPC limited was changed from "National Thermal Power Corporation Private Limited" to National Thermal Power Corporation Limited. In the Fiscal Year (FY) 1982-83, when NTPC limited began its commercial operations of selling power (exact in the year 1983), it earned a total profit of INR 4.5 crores.</p>
<p><strong>Following more changes have been seen in the early beginning phase of the NTPC limited:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>At the end of the year 1985, NTPC limited was able to achieve the 2000 MW power generation capacity in India.</li>
<li>By the year 1986, NTPC limited was able to complete its synchronisation at Singrauli thermal power plant of its first 500 MW unit.</li>
<li>Moving ahead, two years later, in 1988, NTPC limited commissioned two units of thermal power plant (one each in Ramagundam and Rihand) of 500 MW capacity.</li>
<li>NTPC limited acquired the major equity stakes in the Feroze Gandhi Unchahar Thermal Power Station in the year 1992. The subsidiary body of NTPC limited, i.e.,Feroze Gandhi Unchahar Thermal Power Station, was from Uttar Pradesh Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam of Uttar Pradesh.</li>
<li>NTPC limited was able to install more units in the year 1994, by which its capacity crossed 15,000 MW in total.</li>
</ul>
<p>These were the major changes that have been seen in the NTPC limited corporation in its early beginning phase from 1975 to 1994.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Phase 2: New Changes in NTPC limited (from 1995 to 2004)</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the year 1995, NTPC limited took over the majority equity stake in Talcher Thermal Power Station, which was from the Orissa state electricity board. NTPC limited was conferred with the status of "Navratna" by the government of India in the year 1997, and also in the same year, it was able to achieve the milestone of generating a total of 100 billion electricity in a single calendar year. In the year 1998, NTPC limited commissioned its first Naptha-based power plant having a total generating capacity of 350 MW at the Kayamkulam.</p>
<p>The power plant of NTPC limited located at Dadri was certified with ISO-14001 in the year 1999, and the same power plant of NTPC limited had the highest PLF (Plant load factor) in India.</p>
<p><strong>Other than the overview as mentioned above of history phase 2 of NTPC limited, the following more changes have been seen in the same phase history:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>NTPC limited had started construction of its first hydroelectric power plant project in the year 2000 at Himachal Pradesh, and this hydroelectric power plant project has a total capacity of 800 MW.</li>
<li>NTPC limited incorporated the following three subsidiaries: "NTPC Hydro Limited", "NTPC Electric Supply Company Limited", and "NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited" in the year 2002.</li>
<li><strong>Listing of NTPC limited:</strong> In the year 2004 (exact to be 5th November of 2002), NTPC limited got listed on NSE and BSE.

</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Phase 3: Current Scenario in the NTPC (from 2005 to Present)</h3>
<p>In this part, we are going to look at the third phase of the history of NTPC, where we will look from 2005 to the present and see what changes have come in the corporation since then.</p>
<p>It was the October of the year 2005 when the name of the company was changed from National Thermal Power Corporation Limited to NTPC limited, and since then, it is officially known as NTPC limited only. Now, the one question that will surely come to our mind at this point is that why the name of the corporation was changed all of a sudden. The primary or main reason behind changing the name of the corporation to NTPC limited is that at the time company's foray into nuclear as well hydropower plant-based power generation along with the backward integration by the coal mining set up by it.</p>
<p>It was the year 2006 when NTPC limited first set up its power plant unit outside the Indian boundaries. NTPC limited made an agreement with the Sri Lankan government in the year 2006 to set up two units of its power plants (each having capacity of 250 MW), each in the Trincomalee city of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p><strong>During the period of 2008 to 2011, NTPC limited entered into various joint ventures with the following organisations:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Coal India limited</li>
<li>BHEL</li>
<li>SAIL</li>
<li>NHPC</li>
<li>NPCIL</li>
<li>NDMC and,</li>
<li>Bharat forge</li>
</ul>
<p>NTPC limited entered into joint ventures with all the organisations or government corporations to expand its business of power plants and power generation to another level.</p>
<p><strong>Other than the overview of history phase 3 of NTPC limited as we have mentioned above, the following more changes have been seen in the same phase history:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The NTPC limited joined forces to do business with various other state enterprises like Steel Authority of India, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam, National Minerals Development Corporation, and Coal India. This was done by NTPC limited in order to generate and invest more in the coal mining operations through International Coal Ventures Private Limited (ICVL), which was a joint venture in the year 2009.</li>
<li>ICVL had acquired a total of 65% equity share stakes of Benga coal mile (This mile is situated in Mozambique), which is belongs to the Rio Tinto Group of power plants and power generation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These were the present current scenario major changes that we have been seen in the NTPC limited corporation in the current phase from 2005 to the present.</p>

<p><strong>Following were some of the highlighted instances where NTPC limited have faced huge criticism in the past:</strong></p>

Many times the land which is allocated by the state or central government to this public sector company and other PSUs as well have been allotted through the various Land acquisition acts passed by the governments (Central as well as state government). When the land acquisition act for the land allocated is enacted by the government, then it also places a liability on the respective government and PSUs as well to take proper actions for a well-settled rehabilitation of the dispatched residents of that rural or tribal area. If the liability of proper rehabilitation of dispatched residents of the allocated area is not fulfilled, then the Government, as well as the PSUs to which land is allocated, are criticized by the people as well as media. Also, in many tribal or rural areas, local residents have opposed the forcible acquisition of their land where the land acquisition act has been passed or even proposed through the laws by the respective government, as they were not sure or satisfied with the rehabilitation planned for them by the government.</p>
<p><strong>Controversies with the projects of NTPC limited:</strong> There are many projects of NTPC limited where controversies have been seen between this public sector company and the government due to many reasons, and because of this, it has faced a lot of criticism in the past.

<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Rupasiyabagar Khasiabara Hydropower plant</strong> in Pithoragarh of Uttarakhand (near to the border of China) having a proposed capacity of 261 MW power generation is yet to be given investment approval by the government.</li>
<li><strong>Loharinag Pala Hydro Power Project:</strong> The Loharinag Pala Hydro Power Project by the NTPC Limited, which had a total proposed power generation capacity of 600 MW units (150 MW each unit &times; 4 units total), is located on the Bhagirathi River, which is a tributary river to Ganga present in the Uttarkashi district of the Uttarakhand. It is the first project downstream, i.e., from the origin of Ganga at the Gangotri river by the company, and it even reached the advanced stage of establishment. During the advanced stage of setting up of Loharinag Pala Hydro Power Project, it was discontinued by the government of India, and it caused huge criticism to NTPC limited.</li>
<li><strong>The Badarpur thermal power plant</strong> of NTPC limited has been permanently closed by the public sector company on the orders of the Delhi high court and Delhi government. The order was passed to close the Badarpur thermal power plant as it was causing too much pollution in the city as well as in the Delhi NCR area, and because of this, NTPC limited had faced a lot of criticism from many NGOs, environmentalists, and from many other people too. The total power generation capacity of the Badarpur thermal power plant was 750 MW, and it became fully closed or retired on 15th October of 2018.</li>
