<h1 class="h1">Largest Dam in India</h1>
<p>A dam is a type of <strong><em>massive barrier that is constructed across a river or stream</em></strong> to hold back water and form a water reservoir behind it. Dam is mainly used to generate electricity, to suppress or control floods and to supply water for various purposes such as drinking, irrigation, etc. A large number of huge dams are built in India over rivers to generate power and provide water for drinking, irrigation and industrial use.</p>
