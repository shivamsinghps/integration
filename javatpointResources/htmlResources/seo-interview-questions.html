<hr />
<h3 class="h3">8) Who invented the Google?</h3>
<p>It is co-founded in 1998 by Larry Page, an American computer scientist and internet entrepreneur, and Sergey Brin who is also an American computer scientist and internet entrepreneur.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">9) What do you understand by a search engine?</h3>
<p>A search engine is a web-based software program that is developed to search and find information on the World Wide Web. It enables internet users to search the information via the World Wide Web (WWW). The user is required to enter keywords or phrases into the search engines and then search engine searches websites, web pages or documents containing the similar keywords and presents a list of web pages with same keywords in the search engine result pages. </p>
<p>We can say that it generally answers the queries entered by the users in the form of a list of search results. So, it is a web-based tool that enables us to find information on the World Wide Web. Some of the popular search engines are Google, Bing, and Yahoo.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">10) What is a SERP (Search Engine Result Page)?</h3>
<p>A search engine result page is the list of results for a user's search query and is displayed by the search engine. It is displayed in a browser window when the users enter their search queries in the search field on a search engine page.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions-serp.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<p>The list of results generally contains a list of links to web pages that are ranked from the most popular to the least popular. Furthermore, the links also contain the title and a short description of their web pages. Furthermore, SERP not only provides the list of search results, but it may also include advertisements.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">11) How does a search engine work?</h3>
<p>To understand, how a search engine works, we can divide the work of search engines into three different stages: crawling, indexing, and retrieval.</p>
<p><strong>Crawling</strong>: It is performed by software robots called web spiders or web crawlers. Each search engine has its web spiders to perform crawling. In this step, the spiders visit websites or web pages and read them and follow the links to other web pages of the site. Thus by crawling, they can find out what is published on the World Wide Web. Once the crawler visits a page, it makes a copy of that page and adds its URL to the index.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions3.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<p>The web spider generally starts crawling with heavily used servers and popular web pages. It follows the route determined by the link structure and finds new interconnected documents through new links. It also revisits the previous sites to check for the changes or updates in the web pages. If changes are found, it makes a copy of the changes to update the index. </p>
<p><strong>Indexing</strong>: It involves building an index after crawling all websites or web pages found on the World Wide Web. An index of the crawled sites is made based on the type and quality of information provided by them and stored in huge storage facilities. It is like a book that contains a copy of each webpage crawled by the spider. Thus, it collects and organizes the information from all over the internet.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions4.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<p><strong>Retrieval</strong>: In this step, the search engine responds to the search queries made by the users by providing a list of websites with relevant answers or information in a particular order. It keeps the relevant websites, which offer unique and original information, on the top of the search engine result pages. So, whenever, a user performs an online search, the search engine searches its database for the websites or web pages with relevant information and make a list of these sites based on their relevancy and present this list to the users on the search engine result pages.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions5.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">12) What is the usage of an anchor tag in SEO?</h3>
<p>The anchor tag is used to make click-able text written on a hyperlink, i.e., it is a clickable text in a hyperlink. It enhances the user experience as it takes the users directly to a specific area of a webpage. They are not required to scroll down the information to find a particular section. So, it is a way to improve navigation. </p>
<p>It also enables webmasters to keep things in order as there is no need of creating different web pages or splitting up a document. Google also sends users to a specific part of your page using this tag. You can attach anchor tag to a word or a phrase. It takes the reader down to a different section of the page instead of another page. When you use this tag, you create a unique URL on the same page.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">13) What are some techniques of Black Hat SEO?</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Keyword Stuffing</strong>: The search engines study the keywords included in a webpage to index the webpage or a site. So, some people increase the keyword density in their web pages to get a higher ranking. Keywords should be 2 to 4 % of the total world count, increasing keyword density beyond this is known as black hat SEO as it is against the SEO guidelines of Google.</li>
<li><strong>Cloaking</strong>: In this technique, the web pages are coded are in such a way that visitors see different content in a webpage and search engines see different content on the same webpage. Increasing ranking in this way is also against the guidelines of search engine.</li>
<li><strong>Doorway pages</strong>: These pages are rich in keywords and do not have quality content and relevant information. They redirect users to a different page to increase the ranking of that page. It is also against the guidelines of Google. </li>
<li><strong>Hidden Text</strong>: It is the text that can be viewed by the search engine, but visitors cannot view. It is used to include irrelevant keywords and hide text or links to increase the keyword density and improve the internal link structure.</li>
<li><strong>Article Spinning</strong>: It refers to rewriting an article multiple times to produce its different copies in such a way that each copy looks different from other copies and is treated as a new article.</li>
<li><strong>Duplicate Content</strong>: It is the content that is copied from one site and uploaded to another site. It is known as plagiarism.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">14) Which type of website is good for SEO purpose? </h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>A website made on flash. or</li>
<li>A website made on HTML 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>The content presented in a flash website is hard to parse by search engines, so, it is always preferred to build a website in HTML for better SEO prospective.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">15) Which are the most important areas to include your keyword for the SEO purpose?</h3>
<p>Page title, H1, Body text or content, Meta title, Meta description, Anchor links and Image Alt Tags are some of the most important areas where we can include our keywords for the SEO purpose.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">16) What is webmaster tool in SEO?</h3>
<p>A webmaster is a free service by Google which provides free Indexing data, backlinks information, crawl errors, search queries, CTR, website malware errors and submits the XML sitemap. It is a collection of SEO tools that allow you to control your site in Google as well as allows Google to communicate with webmasters. For example, if anything goes wrong like crawling mistakes, plenty of 404 pages, manual penalties, and malware identified, Google will speak to you through this tool. If you use GWT, you don't need to use some other costlier tools. So, it is a free toolset that helps you understand what is going on with your site by providing useful information about your site.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">17) What do you mean by Spider?</h3>
<p>Many search engines use programs called spiders to index websites. The spiders are also known as crawlers or robots. They act as automatic date searching tools that visit every site to find new or updated web pages and links. This process is called web crawling. Spiders follow hyperlinks and gather textual and meta information for the search engine databases. They collect as much information as they can before relaying to the server of the search engine. </p>
<p>Spiders may also rate the content being indexed to help the search engine determine relevancy levels to a search. They are called spiders as they visit many sites simultaneously, i.e. their legs keep spanning a large area of the web. All search engines use spiders to revise and build their indexes.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">18) What are Meta Tags?</h3>
<p>Meta tags are the HTML tags that are used to provide information about the content of a webpage. They are the basic elements of SEO. Meta tags are incorporated in the "head" section of HTML, e.g. <strong>&lt;head&gt;Meta tags are placed here&lt;/head&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>The Meta tags are of three types. Each tag provides specific information about the content of the page. For example:</p>

<li><strong>Title Tag</strong>: It is the most important of all the Meta tags. It tells search engines about the title your webpage, and it is displayed in search engine listings above the URL of your webpage or website. For example: <strong>&lt;title&gt;Title text&lt;/title&gt;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Description Meta tag</strong>: The summary of your site or webpage is incorporated in this tag. It enables the search engine to display a brief description of your page in the SERPs. Through this tag, you tell users what your site is all about and what you are offering. For example: <strong>&lt;meta name="description" content = "your site's summary"/&gt;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Keywords Meta tag</strong>: In this tag, you place all of your main keywords and phrases that describe the content of your webpage. For example: <strong>&lt;meta name="keywords" content="keywords"/&gt;</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">19) Why is the title tag valuable?</h3>
<p>A title tag is an HTML element that is used to specify the title of a page. It is displayed on search engine result pages as a clickable heading just above the URL and at the top of the browser. </p>
<p>In SEO, the title tag is significant. It is highly recommended to include a unique and relevant title that correctly describes the content of a webpage or a website. Thus, it tells the users and search engines about the nature or type of information contained in your webpage. </p>
<p>An ideal title should be between 50 and 60 characters long. You can also place your primary keywords at the start of your title and put the least important keywords at the end. It is the first thing that a search engine analyzes before ranking your webpage.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">20) Does Google use the keyword meta tags?</h3>
<p>No, Google does not use the keyword meta tags in web search rankings. It is believed that Google ignores the meta tags keywords due to their misuse.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">21) What is cloaking?</h3>
<p>Cloaking is a black hat SEO technique that enables you to create two different pages. One page is designed for the users, and the other is created for the search engine crawlers. It is used to present different information to the user than what is presented to the crawlers. Cloaking is against the guidelines of Google, as it provides users with different information than they expected. So, it should not be used to improve the SEO of your site.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions6.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<p>Some Examples of Cloaking:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Presenting a page of HTML text to search engines and showing a page of images or flash to visitors</li>
<li>Including text or keywords into a page only when it is requested by the search engine, not by a human visitor </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">22) Is HTML case-sensitive or case-insensitive?</h3>
<p>HTML is a case-insensitive language because uppercase or lowercase does not matter in this language and you can write your code in any case. However, HTML coding is generally written in lower case.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">23) What is the difference between SEO and SEM?</h3>
<p><strong>SEO</strong>: It is a process of increasing the online visibility, organic (free) traffic or visitors to a website. It is all about optimizing your website to achieve higher rankings in the search result pages. It is a part of SEM, and it gives you only the organic traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Two types:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>On-Page SEO:</strong> It deals with the optimization of a website for maximum visibility in the search engines.</li>
<li><strong>Off-Page SEO:</strong> It deals with gaining natural backlinks from other websites.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SEM</strong>: It stands for search engine marketing. It involves purchasing space on the search engine result page. It goes beyond SEO and involves various methods that can get you more traffic like PPC advertising. It is a part of your overall internet marketing strategy. The traffic generated through SEM is considered the most important as it is targeted. </p>
<p>SEM includes both SEO and paid search. It generally makes use of paid searches such as pay per click (PPC) listings and advertisements. Search ad networks generally follow pay-per-click (PPC) payment structure. It means you only pay when a visitor clicks on your advertisement.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">24) What are the tools used in SEO?</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Google webmaster tools</strong>: Google webmaster tool is a free SEO tool offered by Google. It is a set of SEO tools that allow you to control your website. It informs you if anything goes wrong with your website like crawling mistakes, plenty of 404 pages, malware issues, manual penalties, etc. In other words, Google communicates with webmasters through this tool. You also do not need to use most of the expensive SEO tools if you are using this tool.</li>
<li><strong>Google Analytics</strong>: It is a freemium web analytics service offered by Google. It provides the detailed statistics of the website traffic. It was introduced in November 2005 to track and report website traffic. It is a set of statistics and analytical tools that monitor the performance of your site. It tells you about your visitors and their activities, dwell-time metrics, search terms or incoming keywords and more.</li>
<li><strong>Open site explorer</strong>: This tool provides stats such as overall link counts and the count of domains that are linked to a URL including the anchor text distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Alexa</strong>: It is a ranking system that ranks the websites by web traffic data. The lower the Alexa rank, the more will be the traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Website grader</strong>: It is a free SEO tool that grades the websites on some key metrics such as security, mobile readiness, performance, and SEO.</li>
<li><strong>Google Keyword Planner</strong>: This tool of Google comes with many features. It gives you an estimation of traffic for your target keywords and suggests keywords with high traffic. Thus, you can shortlist the relevant keywords from the list of keywords offered by this tool.</li>
<li><strong>Plagiarism Checker</strong>: There are various tools to check the plagiarized content such as smallseotools.com, plagiarisma.net and more. Using these tools, you can avoid duplicate content and upload the unique or original content on your site.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">25) What are the limitations of the title and description tags?</h3>
<p>The title tag should be between 66-70 characters as the Google generally displays the first 50to 60 characters of the title tag. So, if your title is under 60 characters, there are more chances that your title is displayed properly. Similarly, the Meta description tag should be between 160-170 characters as the search engines tend to truncate descriptions longer than 160 characters.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">26) What methods should you use to decrease the loading time of a website?</h3>
<p>We should follow the following instructions to decrease the loading time of a website:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Optimize images</strong>: You can optimize images and decrease the file size without affecting the quality of that image. You can use the external picture tools to resize your images such as the Photoshop, picresize.com and more. Furthermore, use fewer images (avoid them unless necessary). </li>
<li><strong>Use browser caching</strong>: Caching involves temporary storages of web pages that helps reduce bandwidth and improve performance. When a visitor visits your site, the cached version is presented that saves the server's time and loads pages faster. So, use browser caching to make the process easier and faster for your repeat visitors. </li>
<li><strong>Use content delivery network</strong>: It allows you to distribute your site across several servers in different geographical areas. When visitors request to visit your site, they will get the data from the server closest to them. The closer a server, the more quickly it loads. </li>
<li><strong>Avoid self-hosted videos</strong>: Video files are usually large, so if you upload them to your web pages it can increase their loading time. You can use other video services like Youtube, Vimeo, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Use CSS sprites to reduce HTTP request</strong>: It allows you to combine some images within a single image file by implementing CSS positioning of background. It helps you to save your server bandwidth and thus loading time of the webpage decreases gradually.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">27) Which tool should be preferred between Webmaster and Analytics?</h3>
<p>Webmaster tool should be preferred over Analytics tool because it includes almost all essential tools as well as some analytics data for the search engine optimization. But now due to the inclusion of webmaster data in Analytics, we would like to have access to Analytics.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">28) What is the main usage of search engine spiders?</h3>
<p>A spider is a program used by search engines to index websites. It is also called a crawler or search engine robot. The main usage of search engine spiders is to index sites. It visits the websites and read their pages and creates entries for the search engine index. They act as data searching tools that visit websites to find new or updated content or pages and links.</p>
<p>Spiders do not monitor sites for unethical activities. They are called spiders as they visit many sites simultaneously, i.e., they keep spanning a large area of the web. All search engines use spiders to build and update their indexes.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">29) When is reinclusion applied in a search engine's index?</h3>
<p>If your website is banned by the search engines for using black hat practices and you have corrected the wrongdoings, you can apply for reinclusion. So, it is a process in which you ask the search engine to re-index your site that was penalized for using black hat SEO techniques. Google, Yahoo, and other search engines offer tools where webmasters can submit their site for reinclusion.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">30) What is robot.txt?</h3>
<p>Robots.txt is a text file that gives instructions to the search engine crawlers about the indexing of a webpage, domain, directory or a file of a website. It is generally used to tell spiders about the pages that you don't want to be crawled. It is not mandatory for search engines, yet search engine spiders follow the instructions of the robots.txt. </p>
<p>The location of this file is very significant. It must be located in the main directory otherwise the spiders will not be able to find it as they do not search the whole site for a file named robots.txt. They only check the main directory for these files, and if they don't find the files in the main directory, they assume that the site does not have any robots.txt file and index the whole site.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">31) What is keyword proximity?</h3>
<p>Keyword proximity refers to the distance between the keywords, i.e., it tells how close keywords are to each other in a phrase or body of text. It is used to measure the distance between two keywords in the text. It is used by some search engines to measure the relevancy of a given page to the search request. It specifies that the closer the two keywords in a phrase or a search term, the more relevant will be the phrase. For example, see the keywords "Delhi Digital Photographer" in the search term "Delhi Photographer Ram Kumar specialized in digital photography." The proximity between Delhi and Photographer is excellent, but between the "Photographer" and "digital" proximity is not good as there are four words between them. So, a search term's keywords should be as close to each other as possible.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">32) What is an URL?</h3>
<p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator (URL). It is the web address of an online resource like a website, webpage or a document on the internet. It tells the location and name of the resource as well as the protocol used to access it, i.e., it locates an existing resource on the internet. A URL may contain as many as six parts, and cannot have less than two parts. For example, <a href="http://www.example.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.example.com</a>, in this URL we have two parts: a protocol (http) and a domain (<a href="http://www.example.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.example.com</a>).</p>
<p>A URL for HTTP or HTTPS generally comprises three or four components, such as:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Protocol</strong>: It is used to access the resource on the internet. It can be HTTP, without SSL or HTTPS with SSL. It is connected to the domain name, and the domain name is further connected to the file path. </li>
<li><strong>Domain name</strong>: It is a unique name that identifies a website on the internet. For example, "javatpoint.com". It always includes a top-level domain (TLD) which is ".com" in this example. </li>
<li><strong>Port</strong>: It is a port number, which is usually not visible in a URL, but it is always required. When visible, it comes after the TLD, separated by a colon.</li>
<li><strong>Path</strong>: It is a file or directory on the web server, e.g. "/seo-interview-question" in the URL <a href="seo-interview-questions.html" target="_blank">https://www.javatpoint.com/seo-interview-questions</a>is a path.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3 class="h3">33) How are the words in a URL separated?</h3>
<p>We use hyphens to separates the words in a URL. See the image:</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions8.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">34) What is a domain name?</h3>
<p>A domain name is the name of your website. It identifies one or more IP addresses, e.g., the IP address of domain name "google.com" is "74.125.127.147". Domain names are developed as it is easy to remember a name rather than a long string of numbers.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions9.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<p>A domain is displayed on the address bar of the web browser and may consist of any combination of letters and numbers and can be used with various domain name extensions such as .com, .net and more. Domain name is always unique, i.e., no two websites can have the same domain name.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">35) What is a TLD?</h3>
<p>A TLD is the last part of an Internet address. For example, in xyz.com the TLD is .com. </p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">36) What is ccTLD?</h3>
<p>A ccTLD is a country code top-level domain extension that is assigned to a country. It is based on the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes, which means it can have only two characters, e.g., .us for the United States, .au for Australia, .in for India. So these domain extensions are reserved for countries. See the image given below:</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions10.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">37) What is an internal link?</h3>
<p>An internal link is a URL link placed on your website that points to your another webpage. It is different from an external link which leads to another website. Internal links are very useful regarding SEO as they:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Provide site structure</strong>: The internal links of a website helps search engines to crawl and index your website. Search engine crawlers or robots use internal links to evaluate your website and are better informed while ranking your website on search engine result pages.</li>
<li><strong>Enhance user experience</strong>: The internal links in product pages, blog posts, contact us forms, etc., enhance users' website experience. Furthermore, these links can be used to take prospects to your core pages to convert them into customers.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize bounce rate</strong>: The internal links keeps visitors on your website for longer and thus helps reduce bounce rate and increases the likelihood of them buying your products or services.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">38) Why are backlinks important?</h3>
<p>The backlinks are an indication of the popularity of a website. They are important for SEO as most of the search engines like Google give more value to websites that have a large number of quality backlinks, i.e., a site with more backlinks is considered more relevant than a site with fewer backlinks.</p>
<p>The backlinks should be relevant which means they should come from the sites that have content related to your site or pages otherwise the links if they are coming from sites that have different content, will be treated as irrelevant backlinks by the Search Engine. For example, there is a website about how to rescue orphaned dogs, and it receives a backlink from a website about dog care essentials then this would be a relevant backlink in a search engine assessment than a like from site about automobiles.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">39) What is the difference between an inbound link and an outbound link in SEO?</h3>
<p>An inbound link, which is also known as a backlink, is the incoming link to your site from an external source. It comes from an external site to your site. Whereas, outbound link is a link that starts from your site and points to another website. For example, if xyz.com links to your domain, this link from xyz.com is an inbound or backlink for your domain. However, it is an outbound link for xyz.com. See the image given below:</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions11.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">40) What is link popularity?</h3>
<p>Link popularity refers to the number of backlinks that point towards a website. The backlinks can be of two types: internal and external links. The links to a website from its pages are called internal links and the links from outside sources or other websites are called external links.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions12.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<p>The high link popularity indicates that more people are connected to your site, and it has relevant information. Most of the search engines use link popularity in its algorithm while ranking websites in the SERPs. For example, if two websites have the same level of SEO, the site with higher link popularity will be higher than another site by the search engine.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">41) What are contextual backlinks?</h3>
<p>Contextual backlinks are the links to external websites that are placed within the content of a web page, i.e., they are part of the content of a page. They are generally built from high authority web pages. These links can be used to build your keyword ranking higher in Search Engines and to increase the domain trust online. See the image:</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions13.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">42) What do you understand by crawling?</h3>
<p>Crawling refers to an automated process that enables search engines to visit web pages and gather URLs for indexing. When the crawler visits a page, it makes a copy of that page and adds its URL to the index which is called indexing. The search engines have software robots, which are known as web spiders or web crawlers, for crawling.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions14.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<p>The crawler not only reads the pages but also follows the internal and external links. Thus, they can find out what is published on the World Wide Web. The crawlers also revisit the previous sites to check for the changes or updates in their web pages. If changes are found, it updates the index accordingly.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">43) What is indexing?</h3>
<p>Indexing starts after crawling. It is a process of building an index by adding URLs of web pages crawled by the crawlers. An index is a place where all the data that has been crawled is stored, i.e., it is like a huge book with a copy of each page that is crawled. Whenever users enter search queries, it is the index that provides the results for search queries within seconds. Without an index, it won't be possible for a search engine to render search results so fast.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions15.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<p>So, the index is made of URLs of different web pages visited by the crawler. The information contained in the web pages is provided by the search engines to users for their queries. If a page is not added to the index, it can't be viewed by the users.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">44) What is the World Wide Web?</h3>
<p>The World Wide Web is a like a huge book whose pages are located on multiple servers present throughout the world. These web pages contain information and are connected by links called "hypertext." In a book, we move from one page to another in a sequence, but in World Wide Web, we have to follow hypertext links to visit the desired page.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions16.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<p>So, it is a network of internet servers containing information in the form of web pages, audios, videos, etc. These web pages are formatted in HTML and accessed via HTTP. </p>
<p>World Wide Web was designed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. It is different from the internet which is a network connection used to access the World Wide Web.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">45) What is a website or what do you understand by a website?</h3>
<p>A website is a collection of interlinked web pages or formatted documents that share a single domain and can be accessed over the internet. It may contain only one page or tens of thousands of pages and can be created by an individual, group, or an organization, etc. It is identified by a domain name or web address. For example, when you type the web address over the internet, you will arrive at the home page of that website.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">46) What is a web page?</h3>
<p>A web page is what you see on the screen of a computer or mobile when you type a web address or click on a link or enter a query in a search engine like Google, Bing, etc. A web page typically contains information that may include text, graphics, images, animation, sound, video, etc. See the image given below:</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions17.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">47) What is a web server?</h3>
<p>It is a computer program that is designed to serve or deliver the web pages to users in response to their queries or requests made by their computers or HTTP clients. In other words, it hosts websites on the internet. It uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve pages to computers that are connected to it. See the image given below for more clarification!</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions18.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">48) What is Web Hosting?</h3>
<p>A service that provides space for websites or web pages on special computers called servers. A web hosting enables sites or web pages to be viewed on the internet by the internet users. When users type the website address (domain name) into their browser, their computers connect to the server, and your web pages are delivered to them through a browser.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions19.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<p>The websites are stored and hosted on special computers called servers. So, if you want users to see your website, you are required to publish it with a web hosting service. It is generally measured in terms of disc space you are allotted on the server and the bandwidth you require for accessing the server. While choosing a web hosting services one should evaluate the reliability and customer service of the service provider.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">49) What are organic results?</h3>
<p>Organic results refer to the listings of web pages on the SERPs that appear because of organic SEO such as relevance to the search term or keywords and free white hat SEO techniques. They are also known as free or natural results. The search engine marketing (SEM) is not involved in producing organic results. So, organic results are the natural way of getting top ranking in SERP. The main purpose of SEO is to get a higher ranking for a web page in organic results of the search engines.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions20.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">50) What are the paid results?</h3>
<p>Paid search results are the sponsored ads or links that appear on the SERPs. They are part of Search Engine Marketing in which you have to pay to place your websites or ads on the top of the result pages. The website owners who have a good budget and want results quickly generally pay to Google to display their websites on the top of the result pages for the specific search terms or keywords.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions21.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">51) What is a Canonical URL or Tag?</h3>
<p>Canonical URL, which is also known as a canonical tag, is an HTML element that is used to prevent duplicate content issues. This tag is used when multiple versions of the same page are available over the internet.</p>
<p>It enables you to select the best URL as a canonical URL out of the several URLs of the multiple copies of a webpage. When you mark one version or copy as canonical version, the other versions are considered the variations of the canonical or original version by the search engine. Thus, it is used to resolve content duplication issues.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions22.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<p>In this image, we have marked the URL of the page "<a href="https://www.example.com/toys/cars/yellow" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.example.com/toys/cars/yellow</a> "as canonical URL. So, Google will consider it the original page and the other two pages as its variations, not the duplicates.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">52) What is Meta description?</h3>
<p>Meta descriptions, which are also known as HTML attributes, provide brief information about the content of a web page. They act as preview snippets of the web pages and appear under the URL of your page in SERPs.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions23.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<p>A relevant and compelling meta description brings users from search engine result pages to your website, and thus it also improves the click-through rate (CTR) for your webpage.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">53) Tell the names of most important Google ranking factors?</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>Quality Content</li>
<li>Quality Backlinks </li>
<li>Mobile Friendliness or Optimization </li>
<li>Page Speed</li>
<li>PageRank</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">54) How does the Google ranking works?</h3>
<p>Google has many factors in its algorithm to rank the websites in SERPs. Using its algorithm, it finds the relevant results for the users' queries. </p>
<p>Google keeps updating its ranking factors to give users the best experience and to put a check on black hat SEO techniques. So, Google displays results on the basis of ranking factors such as content, backlinks and mobile optimization.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">55) What is a Sitemap?</h3>
<p>A sitemap refers to the map of a website. It is the detailed structure of a site that includes different sections of your site with internal links.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">56) What is an HTML sitemap?</h3>
<p>An HTML sitemap is an HTML page that contains all the links of all the web pages of a website, i.e., it contains all formatted text files and linking tags of a website. It outlines the first and second level structure of a site so that users can easily find information on the site.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions24.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<p>Thus, it improves the navigation of websites with multiple web pages by listing all the web pages in one place in a user-friendly manner. The HTML sitemaps provide a strong foundation for all the web pages of a website and are primarily concerned with users.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">57) What is an XML sitemap?</h3>
<p>An XML sitemap is exclusively designed for the search engines. It facilitates the functionality of the search engines as it informs the search engines about the number of web pages, the frequency of their updates including the recent updates. This information helps search engine robots in indexing the website. See the image of the sitemap of a website:</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions25.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">58) What do you mean by 301redirect?</h3>
<p>301 redirecting is a method of redirecting users and search engines from the old page URL to a new page URL. The 301 redirect is used to pass the link traffic from the old URL to the new URL. It is a permanent redirect from one URL to another site without typing the URL of the new site. It helps you maintain the domain authority and search rankings when the URL of a site is changed for any reason.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions26.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<p>Furthermore, it allows you to associate common web conventions with one URL to improve the domain authority; to rename or rebrand a site with a new URL; to direct traffic to a new website from other URLs of the same organization. So, you must set up a 301 redirect before moving to a new domain.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">59) What is a 404 error?</h3>
<p>A 404 error is an HTTP response status code which indicates that the requested page could not be found on the server. This error is generally displayed in the internet browser window just like web pages.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions27.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">60) What are the causes of HTTP 404 errors?</h3>
<p>HTTP 404 error is technically a client-side error which means it is your mistake, i.e., the requested page is not present in your website. If you had maintained that page in your site, it would have been indexed by the crawler and thus would have been present in the server. Furthermore, you also receive this error, when you mistype a URL or when a webpage or resource is moved without redirecting the old URL to the new one. So, whenever you move your webpage redirect the old URL to the new URL to avoid this error as it may affect the SEO of your site.</p>

<h3 class="h3">83) What is HTTPS/SSL Update?</h3>
<p>HTTPS, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), is a protocol for secure communication on the World Wide Web.

It encrypts all data or communication between the server and the browser.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions35.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<p>The websites which use HTTP protocol, the data is transmitted between the site server and the browser as plain text, so anyone who intercepts your connection can read this data.

An HTTPS connection provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Website Authentication</li>

</ul>
<hr />

However, the keyword density of 2 to 4 % is considered suitable for SEO.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">86) What is keyword stuffing?</h3>
<p>Keyword stuffing refers to increasing the keyword density beyond a certain level to achieve higher ranking in the SERPs. As we know, web crawlers analyze keywords to index the web pages, so some SEO practitioners exploit this feature of the search engine by increasing the keywords in a page. This way of improving the ranking is against the guidelines of Google, so it is considered a black hat SEO technique, and it should be avoided.</p>
<hr />

It may be caused by building too many links within a short period of time. </p>
<p>Any type of website can be placed in a sandbox. However, the new websites who want to rank for highly competitive keyword phrases are more prone to the sandbox. There is no fixed duration for a site to stay in the sandbox. Generally, a website can stay in the Sandbox for one to six months. The logic behind the sandbox is that new websites may be not as relevant as older sites.</p>

<hr />
<h3 class="h3">101) What is CTR?</h3>
<p>CTR stands for Click through Rate. It is calculated by dividing the number of times a link appears on a search engine result page (impression) by the number of times it is clicked by users. For example, if you have 10 clicks and 100 impressions, your CTR would be 10%. </p>

The lower the Alexa rank, the more popular a site will be. An increase or decrease in the rank shows how your SEO campaigns are doing. </p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">105) What is RankBrain in SEO?</h3>
<p>RankBrain is Google's machine-learning artificial intelligence system designed to help Google to process search results and deliver more relevant information to users. It is a part of the Google's Hummingbird search algorithm. It can learn and recognize new patterns and then revisit SERPs to provide more relevant information. </p>
<p>It has the ability to embed the written language into mathematical entities called vectors that Google can understand. For example, if it does not understand a sentence, it can guess its meaning with similar words or sentences and filter the information accordingly to provide accurate and relevant results to users.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">106) What do you understand by Crawl Stats in SEO?</h3>
<p>The crawl stats give the overview of Googlebot activity on our website. It provides information about the Googlebot's activity on your site for the last 90 days. The crawl number tends to increase as you increase the size of your site by adding more content or web pages. </p>
<p>The crawl stats typically provide the following information:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The number of pages crawled per day by Googlebot</li>
<li>Kilobytes downloaded per day for crawling pages</li>
<li>Time spent in downloading a page</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">107) How would you maximize the frequency of crawling of your website by search engines? </h3>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Update your pages regularly:</strong> You must have to frequently add new, original and quality content on the website for this.</li>
<li><strong>Server's Uptime:</strong> If a site is down for a long time, the crawlers reduce the frequency of crawling for that site. So, host your website on a reliable server with good uptime.</li>
<li><strong>Create Sitemaps:</strong> You can submit sitemap of your website to make your site discover quickly by search engine spiders. In WordPress, you can generate dynamic sitemap with Google XML sitemap plugin and submit it to Webmaster tool.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Duplicate Content:</strong> The copied content tends to reduce the crawling rate as using plagiarized material is against the guidelines of Google. So, always provide new and unique content.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce site's loading time:</strong> The loading time should be less as the crawl has a limited time and if it spends too much time on big images included in the content, it will have no or less time to visit other pages.</li>
<li><strong>Build more links:</strong> You can build more backlinks from regularly crawled sites. Interlinking helps search engines to crawl deep pages of your site. So, whenever, you create a new page add a link in your old related pages to your new page.</li>
<li><strong>Use optimized images:</strong> The crawlers cannot read images directly so always use alt tags to provide a description that search engine crawlers can read and index.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">108) What is referral traffic?</h3>
<p>The referral traffic refers to the visitors that come to your site from the direct links on other websites rather than from the search engine. In simple words, the visits to your domain directly from other domains are called referral traffic. For example, a site that likes your page may post a link recommending your page. The visitor on this site may click on this link and visit your site. </p>
<p>You can also increase referral traffic by leaving links on other blogs, forums, etc. when you put a hyperlink of your page on other websites like forums users will click and visit your webpage. Google tracks such visits as referral visits or traffic. So, it is a Google's way of reporting visits that come to your site from sources outside of search engine.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">109) What is keyword stemming?</h3>
<p>Keyword stemming is the process of finding the root word of a search query and then creating new keywords by adding prefixes, suffixes and pluralizing the root word. For example, a query "Searcher" can be broken down to the word "search" and then more words can be created by adding prefixes, suffixes or pluralizing this root word, such as research, searcher, searchers, searching, searchable, etc.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/seo-interview-questions48.png" alt="SEO Interview Questions" />
<p>Similarly, you can add the prefix "en" to "large" to make it "enlarge" and add a suffix "ful" to "power" to make it "powerful." This practice allows you to expand your keyword list and thus helps get more traffic.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">110) What is LSI?</h3>
<p>LSI stands for Latent Semantic Indexing. It is a part of the Google's algorithm which enables the search engine to understand the content of a page and the intent of the search queries. It identifies related words in content to better classify web pages and thus to deliver more relevant and accurate search results. It can understand synonyms and the relationship between words and thus can interpret web pages more deeply to provide relevant information to users. For example, if someone searches with a keyword "CAR," it will show related things such as car models, car auctions, car race, car companies and more. See the image: </p>
