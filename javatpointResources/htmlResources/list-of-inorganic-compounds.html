<td>Barium chloride is an inorganic compound. It is one of the most common water-soluble salts of barium. Like most other barium salts, it is white, toxic, and imparts a yellow-green coloration to a flame. It is also hygroscopic, converting first to the dihydrate BaCl2(H2O)2. It has limited use in the laboratory and industry.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Barium chromate</strong></td>
<td>BaCrO4</td>
<td>Barium chromate, named barium tetraoxochromate(VI) by the IUPAC, is yellow sand-like powder. It is a known oxidizing agent and produces a green flame when heated, a result of the barium ions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Barium ferrate</strong></td>
<td>BaFeO4</td>
<td>Barium ferrate is the chemical compound of the formula BaFeO4. This is a rare compound containing iron in the +6 oxidation state. The ferrate(VI) ion has two unpaired electrons, making it paramagnetic.[3] It is isostructural with BaSO4 and contains the tetrahedral [FeO4]2- anion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Barium ferrite</strong></td>
<td>BaFe12O19</td>
<td>Barium ferrite, abbreviated BaFe, BaM, is the chemical compound. This and related ferrite materials are components in magnetic stripe cards and loudspeaker magnets. BaFe is described as Ba2+(Fe3+)12(O2-)19. The Fe3+ centers are ferromagnetically coupled. This area of technology is usually considered to be an application of the related fields of materials science and solid-state chemistry.<br>
Barium ferrite is a highly magnetic material, has a high packing density [clarification needed], and is a metal oxide. Studies of this material date at least as far back as 1931, and it has found applications in magnetic card strips, speakers, and magnetic tapes. One area, in particular, it has found success in is long-term data storage; the material is magnetic, resistant to temperature change, corrosion, and oxidization.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Barium fluoride</strong></td>
<td>BaF2</td>
<td>Barium fluoride is an inorganic compound. It is a colorless solid that occurs in Nature as the rare mineral frankdicksonite. Under standard conditions, it adopts the fluorite structure and, at high pressure, the PbCl2 structure. Like CaF2, it is resilient to and insoluble in water. Above ca. 500 &deg;C, BaF2 is corroded by moisture, but in dry environments, it can be used up to 800 &deg;C. Prolonged exposure to moisture degrades transmission in the vacuum UV range. It is less resistant to water than calcium fluoride, but it is the most resistant of all the optical fluorides to high-energy radiation, though its far-ultraviolet transmittance is lower than that of the other fluorides. It is quite hard, very sensitive to thermal shock, and fractures quite easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Barium hydroxide</strong></td>
<td>Ba(OH)2</td>
<td>Barium hydroxide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula Ba(OH)2(H2O)x. The monohydrate (x =1), known as baryta or baryta-water, is one of the principal compounds of barium. This white granular monohydrate is the usual commercial form. Barium hydroxide is used in analytical chemistry for the titration of weak acids, particularly organic acids. Its clear aqueous solution is guaranteed to be free of carbonate, unlike those of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, as barium carbonate is insoluble in water. This allows the use of indicators such as phenolphthalein or thymolphthalein (with alkaline color changes) without the risk of titration errors due to the presence of carbonate ions, which are much less basic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Barium iodide</strong></td>
<td>BaI2</td>
<td>Barium iodide is inorganic. The compound exists as an anhydrous and a hydrate (BaI2(H2O)2), both of which are white solids. When heated, hydrated barium iodide converts to an anhydrous salt. The hydrated form is freely soluble in water, ethanol, and acetone. The structure of the anhydrous form resembles that of lead(II) chloride, with each Ba center bound to nine iodide ligands and has a crystalline packing structure that is quite similar to BaCl2.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Barium manganate</strong></td>
<td>BaMnO4</td>
<td>Barium manganate is an inorganic compound. It is used as an oxidant in organic chemistry. It belongs to a class of compounds known as manganates, in which the manganese resides in a +6 oxidation state. Manganate should not be confused with permanganate in which contains manganese(VII). Barium manganate is a powerful oxidant popular in organic synthesis and can be used in a wide variety of oxidation reactions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Barium nitrate</strong></td>
<td>Ba(NO3)2</td>
<td>Barium nitrate is an inorganic compound. It, like most barium salts, is colorless, toxic, and water-soluble. It burns with a green flame and is an oxidizer; the compound is commonly used in pyrotechnics.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Barium oxalate</strong></td>
<td>Ba(C2O4)</td>
<td>Barium oxalate, a barium salt of oxalic acid, is a white, odorless powder that is sometimes used as a green pyrotechnic colorant generally in specialized pyrotechnic compositions containing magnesium. Though largely stable, barium oxalate can be reactive with strong acids. A mild skin irritant, the substance is considered toxic when ingested, causing nausea, vomiting, kidney failure, and injury to the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
It is different from most pyrotechnic colorants in that it is a reducing agent and not an oxidizing agent. It is extremely insoluble in water and converts to the oxide form when heated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Barium oxide</strong></td>
<td>BaO</td>
<td>Barium oxide is a white hygroscopic non-flammable compound. It has a cubic structure and is used in cathode ray tubes, crown glass, and catalysts. It is harmful to human skin and, if swallowed in large quantities, causes irritation. Excessive quantities of barium oxide may lead to death.<br>
It is prepared by heating barium carbonate with coke, carbon black, or tar or by thermal decomposition of barium nitrate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Barium permanganate</strong></td>
<td>Ba(MnO4)2</td>
<td>Barium permanganate is a chemical compound. Barium permanganate may be produced by disproportionation of barium manganate in a mildly acidic solution or by oxidation of barium manganate with strong oxidants. Preparations relying on aqueous reactions of barium manganate are an extremely slow process due to the low solubility of the manganate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Barium peroxide</strong></td>
<td>BaO2</td>
<td>Barium peroxide is an inorganic compound. This white solid (gray when impure) is one of the most common inorganic peroxides, and it was the first peroxide compound discovered. Being an oxidizer and giving a vivid green color upon ignition (as do all barium compounds), it finds some use in fireworks; historically, it was also used as a precursor for hydrogen peroxide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Barium sulfate</strong></td>
<td>BaSO4</td>
<td>Barium sulfate (or sulfate) is an inorganic compound. It is a white crystalline solid that is odorless and insoluble in water. It occurs as the mineral barite, which is the main commercial source of barium and materials prepared from it. The opaque white appearance and its high density are exploited in its main applications.</td>
