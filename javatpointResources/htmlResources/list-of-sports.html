<p>It is scientifically proven that exercising is good for our physical health as well as psychological health. Exercising has abundant benefits, which include health benefits like maintaining our cholesterol level, helping in strengthening our bones, and also reducing the risk of stroke by 50%. When we exercise, certain chemicals are released from our brain, which includes endorphins that help us in relieving stress. If endorphins are produced at higher levels, it helps us to focus and improves our memory, retaining power.</p>
