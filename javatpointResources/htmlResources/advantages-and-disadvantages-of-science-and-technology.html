<h2 class="h2">Disadvantages of Science and Technology</h2>
<p>It is a well-observed fact that the nature of science is very dynamic. The scientific concepts that were viable two hundred years ago have now lost their credibility.</p>
<p>Technology is a very beneficial aspect of human life that makes everything more efficient, but it also has a lot of disadvantages that cannot be overlooked. New scientific innovations and concepts are present worldwide, which would also lose their credibility in introducing new concepts. The ever-changing nature of science and technology can be said to be the biggest disadvantage of it. The rapidly evolving nature of science doesn't allow the common folks to keep up with it and many people stay left behind.</p>
<p>To make science and technology more efficient and sustainable, one must make endeavors and know about the faults in these concepts. Some of the disadvantages of science and technology are:</p>
<p><strong>1. Science and Technology can be Misused</strong></p>
<p>The world in which we live is filled with amazing inventions and discoveries made in the fields of science, and it has led everyone to depend on the benefits of it completely, which is a very bad thing. The complete dependence of anyone to anything can lead to the misuse of resources and time, which can be said in the case of science and technology also. The gadgets and the technologies present today are meant to be efficient for everyone and save time, but it turns out that these technologies have become a great distraction to everyone. The availability of the internet is a very innovative feature present to the people of our century. Still, many folks tend to use the features available on the internet with bad intentions and get themselves and their families in huge trouble. The misuse of technologies can also be seen in the case of televisions, mobile phones, and computers. These gadgets are designed for entertainment purposes and to also increase efficiency. Still, it can be very commonly observed that the uses of these technologies are made in bad things which are not appropriate for society. Such misuse of the inventions of science and technology should be stopped.</p>
<p><strong>2. Inventions in Science and Technology can have a disturbing nature.</strong></p>
<p>Science and technology are utilized at every point of production and manufacturing. Various methods of science have brought significant changes to our world, including industrialization. Technologies can be very beneficial for obtaining raw materials and finding out the compositions of our earth. Although it is important how science and its integrated technologies have changed the world, it is also to be noted how nature has been constantly depleted and exploited to reach scientific advancements. The rapid increase in factories and thermal power plants exploits natural flora and fauna. The modernization of the world has made us completely unaware of our surroundings and the earth. For example, the birds that get killed by the propeller of an airplane, the land that turns infertile because of the contamination caused by the factories, and the air pollution caused by the gas emitted by vehicles and industrial plants. The harm inflicted upon nature is real and should be controlled using any technology. The air pollution index in our national capital (New Delhi) has reached so low that the State Government had to install imported air filters to maintain the air quality. All these things should not be ignored, and the use of science and technology should not be done blindly.</p>
<p><strong>3. Science and Technology can be harmful because of the crazy experiments</strong></p>
<p>Scientists are considered one of the most exceptional academicians in society, and everyone looks upto them and their innovative scientific inventions. The world has advanced slowly and slowly only because of the mind-blowing inventions in science. It should also be mentioned that scientists are also humans and tend to make mistakes like everyone else. In the modern world, the competition in the field of science has risen tremendously, and there are a lot of new inventions every world-changing day. It puts a lot of unwanted pressure on scientists to make a certain breakthrough, and they perform peculiar inventions in such cases. These inventions can sometimes be very dangerous, as it is a well-known fact that scientific experiments can be very dangerous. If not performed carefully, they can also be fatal to human life and have serious implications for nature. In 2010, a power plant in Japan was brought down by a fire that erupted because of some unforeseen experiment inside the power plant. This fire resulted in a huge loss of resources and many lives. There have been a lot of such instances in many countries over the years where scientists have gone out of their way to conduct crazy experiments and risked the well-being of the people around them. Many scientists worldwide are focusing on creating a super-soldier robot that can endure any condition and be helpful in war. However, the repercussions of creating such a super-soldier robot can negatively impact our whole future and our livelihood.</p>
<p><strong>4. Science and Technology can harm animals and people</strong></p>
<p>Science is a very vast concept, and it is impossible to explore it in its complete essence. Scientific technologies have facilitated a lot of things in the world, but they have also created a harmful atmosphere for animals and people around such technologies. For example, the machinery used to extract oil and other essential minerals from the earth's crust is a very advanced technology. It has facilitated millions of people worldwide but has serious effects on nature. The fish and the animals that live around such digging machinery cannot survive and die. The workers working on such machines also get hazardous diseases and suffer the consequences all their life. The effect of science and technology on the lives of animals and other people is irreversible. It is very permanent, and it leaves an individual very helpless. Everyone has to utilize technology in today's world to cope or to get employed, and by using such technologies, they are prone to the side effects that the use of such technology will bring down.</p>
<p><strong>5. New developments in Science and Technology can have unintended consequences</strong></p>
<p>It is the most common issue that is faced in the world of science and technology. We are all well aware that there are a lot of new inventions in the areas of science and new forms of technologies come into light every day. All these new technologies promise to facilitate human development, but humans do not know the adverse effects of such technologies. For example, when the internet was introduced to the world, it was intended to serve as a tool for information sharing and networking. With time the internet expanded, and it started having a lot of other features which were beneficial to society at large. It was all very well going in the field of the internet. The malicious activities started commencing, and the new world of cybercrime and cybercriminals came into the picture, which was completely unintended. It goes on to show that even the most innovative technology of humankind can also have consequences, and no technology present is one hundred percent foolproof. The genetic advances that are being made in the field of medical science can also be considered as an example. The experiments that are made in the areas of genetic science are very advanced. They may lead to finding the cure for many diseases that are unknown to the world. Still, these modifications in the genetic science field can also harm many animals and human beings, just like all the other innovations/ discoveries.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are a lot of pros and cons to using any form of technology or getting indulges in any scientific experiment. The technologies that have been invented and the advances already made in the field of various forms of science will last forever, and they will not perish even if problems are associated with such technologies.</p>
<p>So, to strive, people worldwide should be well-versed in the technologies they use daily. People should also be aware of such technologies' positives and negatives, as humanity's future depends on science and technology.</p>
