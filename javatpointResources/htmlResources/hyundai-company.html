<h2 class="h2">About Hyundai Motor Company:</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/company/images/hyundai-company.png" alt="Hyundai Company" />
<ol class="points">
<li>More than 120,000 Hyundai Motor Company employees, founded in 1967, are dedicated to resolving the world's transportation problems. Over 200 nations have the firm operating there.</li>
<li>Hyundai Motor is accelerating its journey of becoming a provider of intelligent mobility solutions based on the Company's brand promise of "Progress for Humanity."</li>
<li>The business pursues open innovation to launch future mobility services while investing in the latest technology, like robots and Urban Air Mobility (UAM), to create innovative mobility solutions.</li>
<li>To ensure a sustainable future for the environment, Hyundai will keep working to introduce zero-emission vehicles furnished with Advanced electric and hydrogen fuel cell technologies.</li>
<li>The Hyundai Engineering & Construction Company established the Hyundai Motor Company as a subsidiary in 1967. The business first built cars and trucks for the Ford Company in its vehicle manufacturing.</li>
<li>Their first vehicle, the Hyundai Cortina, was created in 1975 in collaboration with Ford Motor Company.</li>
<li>With a 2% market share in the global retail market, they moved to the position of the 13th largest carmaker in the world during the next two years.</li>
<li>The business decided in 1975 to create its automobile, which it would market under the name "Hyundai." Their first vehicle, the "Hyundai Pony," was created by five of the top British automobile engineers they hired. Due to its compact size and reasonable price, the automobile quickly reached the top of the sales rankings in South Korea.</li>
<li>The Hyundai Pony arrived on the Canadian market, where it promptly gained the position of the best-selling vehicle. Their output had surpassed 1 million vehicles by 1985.</li>
<li>They first entered the American market in 1986 with the new "Hyundai Excel" vehicle. This automobile's high quality and affordable price also contributed to its success as a great seller. More than 160,000 units were sold in 1986, and 260,000 were sold in the following year.</li>
<li>Hyundai has now made a name for itself as a strong contender in the global car market.</li>
<li>The Medium Sonata, their next offering, was released in 1988. Although the American market did not favor this model, Hyundai was already producing 4,000,000 vehicles annually at the time.</li>
<li>Hyundai reorganized by making significant investments in its automobiles' quality, design, development, and production. As a result, they developed the first unique four-cylinder gasoline engine with its gearbox, the Alpha.</li>
<li>All their vehicles in the United States now come with a 10-year or 10,000-mile warranty. As a result, their reputation was enhanced, and more people began to select Hyundai vehicles over those made by other manufacturers.</li>
<li>It continues to enjoy success because of the introduction of well-liked car models including the Hyundai Genesis, Santa Fe, Elantra, and Tucson.</li>
<li>Hyundai has won several honors for its cars' longevity and fuel efficiency.</li>
<li>By 1995, Hyundai had established sales in nations including Australia, New Zealand, Egypt, and Japan, where it presented models that matched each nation's needs.</li>
<li>The second-largest carmaker in the nation, Kia Motors, was acquired by Hyundai in 1998 for 51% of its shares. It had production facilities in Turkey, the Czech Republic, China, Pakistan, and India in 2000. More than 2,500,000 units were sold, creating $56 billion in revenue for the Company in 2004.</li>
<li>Hyundai was the world's fourth-largest automaker in 2011, with more than 4.04 million vehicles sold, after only G.M., Volkswagen, and Toyota.</li>
<li>Hyundai and its subsidiary Kia sold more than 7 million cars in 2012, selling 4.5 million globally.</li>
<li>As of 2013, Hyundai's operations worldwide produced more than 3,000,000 units annually. It earns more than 82 billion dollars in sales and employs about 75,000 people. Hyundai began in the car sector cautiously and has since developed into one of the most reputable four-wheeler manufacturers worldwide.</li>
<li>Hyundai's success results from its ongoing commitment to growth and client happiness. Global sales for Hyundai Motor in 2021 will reach 3.89 million vehicles. The company wants to sell more than 4.3 million cars globally in 2022.</li>

<h2 class="h2">Awards And Recognition:</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/company/images/hyundai-company2.png" alt="Hyundai Company" />
<ol class="points">
<li>On May 11, 2022, in Seoul, Three awards were given to Hyundai Motor Company at the 2022 Autocar Awards. The judges of the oldest automotive publication in the world honored SangYup Lee, Executive Vice President and Head of the Hyundai Global Design Center, with the Design Hero of the Year award in addition to the Hyundai i20 N and Hyundai Santa Fe, which were named Britain's Most Affordable Driver's Cars and Best Large Car, respectively.</li>
<li>The annual Autocar Awards honor the finest in the automobile industry, whether it be new technology or exceptional design. In the presentation, Britain's Best Driver's Cars and Britain's Best Cars Awards were first presented in 2022, providing an even more thorough insight into the automotive sector. The stunning Silverstone Wing hosted a ceremony in person this year.</li>
<li>Autocar awards the title of Design Hero of the Year to someone who has significantly influenced automotive design throughout their career, not only in the previous year. The IONIQ 5, which recently won the World Car Design of the Year, World Car of the Year, and World Electric Vehicle of the Year honors, is one notable example of SangYup Lee's work as the head of the Hyundai Global Design Center.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, under Lee's direction, the reviewers were satisfied with Hyundai's design quality across the board. Hyundai took home awards in nine categories at the iF design Awards 2021, continuing a streak of nine years of success. The Prophecy concept car, which was also nominated "Best of the Best" at the Red Dot design awards, received one of Hyundai's four GOOD DESIGN Awards beginning in 2021.</li>
<li>As the top designer for Hyundai and Genesis, SangYup Lee joined Hyundai in 2016 and currently oversees a staff of 700 designers, according to Autocar's editor-in-chief Mark Tisshaw. At any given time, 50 production cars are being built at 11 design centers across the world under his direction. In particular for the IONIQ 5 and the upcoming</li>
<li>IONIQ 6 and IONIQ 7, as hinted at by the Prophecy and Seven ideas, he "has masterminded a shift in Hyundai design that has seen it become more appreciated "as per the press announcement.</li>
<li>"It's a wonderful pleasure to now be sitting beside some of the individuals I consider to be my design heroes," Lee remarked, referring to former winners of Autocar's Design Hero Award. We appreciate the Autocar team for bestowing this distinguished honor on the efforts of the Hyundai Global Design Center. On behalf of all of our designers and engineers, who are devoted, brilliant, and constantly inventive and who continue to reinvent our brand throughout the world, I sincerely appreciate this honor</li>
<li>At the Autocar Awards, Hyundai Motor won two other product categories, including Britain's Most Affordably Priced Driver's Car for the i20 N, of which Tisshaw noted: "The i20 N gained victory here by quite a margin. The i20 N won 102 points, easily beating out the second place after five judges gave each car a score of 25. Even from the remarkable level of the bigger i30 N, this car advances the N sub-brand far forward and is a solid, tenacious, and serious option for keen drivers.</li>
<li>Since the i20 N's debut in 2019, it has won several honors, including Top Gear Car of the Year and U.K. Performance Car of the Year. The well-equipped i20 N leverages the strengths of Hyundai's well-known, performance-driven N brand and the popularity of the i20. The multiple-rally-winning i20 Coupe WRC vehicle was an engineering model for the i20 N, a genuine sporting legend. It is equally comfortable, providing its distinct brand of thrilling performance on both the road and the racetrack.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the Hyundai Santa Fe was awarded Autocar's Best Large Car, with Tisshaw saying, "If you believe huge cars can't be thrifty and well-priced, or those hardworking SUVs can't feel luxurious or welcome, or those plug-in hybrids make too many sacrifices to be practical in real-world family traveling, Santa Fe stands ready to convince you that you're wrong."</li>
<li>Since its launch in the United Kingdom in 2001, Santa Fe has been Hyundai's longest-running SUV. The D-segment SUV has earned praise for its comfort and roominess, extensive standard equipment, and practical cabin design. The most recent model offers many changes to provide buyers with a more luxurious option. It also has a bold, distinctive new look, various innovative technologies, and safety measures. For the first time, buyers have the option of a hybrid or plug-in hybrid engine.</li>
<li>A major success for Hyundai was winning in these highly competitive product categories, according to Young Kim, Head of the Product Division at Hyundai Motor Group. "It's a tribute to the effort to create products that are in a class by themselves and to the incredible people that lead and work in our design and product development teams. Even though the Santa Fe and i20 N are entirely different vehicles, both were made with the same technical skill and innovation.</li>
<li>To speed up its transformation into a provider of intelligent transportation solutions, Hyundai Motor has updated its "Strategy 2025."</li>
