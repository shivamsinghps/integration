Beautiful gardens, traditional homes, and spectacular natural beauty may all be found in Iran. Even the country's eateries and lodgings are magnificently ornamented with vibrant stained-glass windows. Here, we discuss some beautiful places as follows.</p>
<h2 class="h2">1. Azadi Tower, Tehran</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran3.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p><strong><em>Tehran's most distinctive landmark</em></strong>, the Azadi Tower, is a must-see while in the city. It was created in 1971 as a memorial to the 2,500th anniversary of the Persian Empire by an architectural student.</p>
<p>This tower's highly distinctive design combines modern and conventional Persian architectural elements. Its large arch, covered with 8,000 pieces of white marble, makes this evident. The tower is located in Azadi Square, which is also highly important because it was a frequent location for protest during the 1979 Islamic Revolution and continues to be so today.</p>
<p>You may take an elevator or staircases to the top of Azadi Tower, which offers stunning city views. A cafe and a few galleries are also located at the tower's base.</p>
<h2 class="h2">2. Golestan Palace, Tehran</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran4.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>Exploring the most <strong><em>stunning historical structure</em></strong> in the city, the UNESCO-listed Golestan Palace is one of the top places to visit in Tehran. This magnificent structure, which served as the official house of the Qajar dynasty, which governed Iran from 1789 and 1925, presents a stunning combination of traditional Iranian and modern European architectural forms, which were prominent in much of the country's 19th and 20th-century artwork.</p>
<p>The 17 buildings that make up Golestan Palace, which include several magnificent rooms, chambers, museums, and gardens, may easily engage half a day of your time. They were all constructed during the regime of the Qajar rulers.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran5.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>It might take time to decide where to begin your journey to the enormous Golestan Palace. The majestic <strong><em>Karim Khani Nook</em></strong>, where the founder of the Zand dynasty lived from 1751 to 1779, and the splendid Mirror Hall, where royal marriages and coronations were performed, are two important locations you are not to be missed for a visit.</p>
<p>Remember to see the <strong><em>Edifice of the Sun</em></strong>, a palace that provided the Shahs with a breathtaking view of the city, and Brilliant Hall, renowned for its remarkable display of mirror work created by Iranian artists.</p>
<p>Entirely in two to three hours may explore Golestan Palace. After all the exploring, visitors may relax by the lovely pond in the main yard. The crowded Tehran Grand Bazaar, an excellent spot to view local life, is located just next to the palace.</p>
<h2 class="h2">3. Imamzadeh Saleh, Tehran</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran6.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>The stunning Imamzadeh Saleh, commonly known as the <strong><em>Tajrish Mosque</em></strong>, should be visited when you have additional time in Tehran. <strong><em>Saleh, the son of Musa al-Kadhim (the seventh Shia Imam), is buried here.</em></strong></p>
<p>Visitors can see some magnificent tilework on the mosque's minarets and dome, and the inside is ornamented with spectacular mirror work, which is rather typical in Iranian temples. For additional tourist shopping and a closer look at local life, visit the vibrant Tajrish Bazaar nearby.</p>
<h2 class="h2">4. Nasir Ol Molk Mosque, Shiraz</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran7.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>Even though Shiraz is home to several beautiful mosques, the magnificent <strong><em>Nasir Ol Molk Mosque</em></strong> comes out of its beauty. This mosque, completed in 1888 under the Qajar dynasty, is renowned for its numerous coloured stained-glass windows that allow the rising sun to create a magnificent light display on the floor.</p>
<p>Nasir Ol Molk Mosque is one of the <strong><em>top beautiful destinations</em></strong> in Iran because of this and is exceptionally well known among photographers. If you visit Iran, you must experience this mosque's rainbow hues and heavenly light effects. It is highly unusual and gives you the impression that you are entering a kaleidoscope.</p>
<p>The outside of the Nasir Ol Molk Mosque is gorgeous as well. It includes a magnificent courtyard with a pond, and its colourful tilework represents the impact of the west on Iranian architecture in the 19th century. France, the United Kingdom, and Germany transported many tiles to construct this mosque and other Qajar-era buildings.</p>
<p>These tiles feature common themes in European art, including scenes of nature, ladies, and European architecture. The magnificent tilework on the mosque's interior and exterior might fascinate you.</p>
<h2 class="h2">5. Shah Cheragh Shrine, Shiraz</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran8.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>One of Shiraz's holiest sites is the loved and respected Shah Cheragh Shrine, also known as the <strong><em>"King of the Light,"</em></strong> which is not far from the Nasir Ol Molk Mosque.</p>
<p>This name has a strange history; in about 900 AD, it directed a traveller to a lighted grave after he followed a mystic light he spotted from a distance. After discovering a significant Muslim figure's body inside, a tomb was constructed to contain the burial.</p>
<p>The location expanded through the years and eventually became a significant <strong><em>Shia Muslim pilgrimage place.</em></strong> The Shah Cheragh Shrine is now a recognized destination visited by visitors from all over the world after completing many stages of renovations.</p>
<p>The shrine's interior is even more impressive than the external appearance, which amazes you with its extraordinarily delicate mirrorwork covering the walls, ceilings glitter and shimmering like diamonds. This vision is priceless.</p>
<h2 class="h2">6. Sayyed Alaeddin Hossein Shrine, Shiraz</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran9.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>A comparatively less well-known shrine, the <strong><em>Sayyed Alaeddin Hossein Shrine</em></strong>, is only a short do go from the renowned Shah Cheragh Shrine. This location, constructed during the Safavid period (which governed Iran from 1501 to 1736), is a hidden treasure; it lacks the vast tourist numbers of the Shah Cheragh Shrine but is just as magnificent and spectacular.</p>
<p>Although Sayyed Alaeddin Hossein Temple may appear to be an ordinary mosque from the outside, the interior is packed with millions of shimmering glass shards of all different colours. You can enjoy the beautiful mirror work in peace, an authentic and less crowded experience than the previous shrine.</p>
<h2 class="h2">7. Eram Garden, Shirine</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran10.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>Shiraz is not simply home to magnificent mosques and temples; it is also the area of Eram Garden, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of Iran's most <strong><em>exquisite Persian gardens.</em></strong> Walking through this garden, one might increasingly feel that they are in the paradise depicted in the Quran as "Eram," which is a paradise for the blessed.</p>
<p>In reality, you'll be surrounded by more than 45 plant types, 200 varieties of roses, and several fruit trees, such as a well-known cypress tree that is 3,000 years old. It's easy to feel comfortable in this beautiful environment with the sound of birds singing and the scent of flowers all around you.</p>
<p>Eram Garden is believed to have been completed in the 13th century under the <strong><em>Seljuk empire</em></strong>, while its exact construction date is unknown. The University of Shiraz now owns the garden after being passed down and rebuilt several times. You may also see tiles with poetry by the renowned Persian poet Hafez carved on the grand palace in front of the pool.</p>
<h2 class="h2">8. Tomb Of Hafez, Shiraz</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran11.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>The <strong><em>beautiful Tomb of Hafez</em></strong>, a destination full of lyrical energy and massive importance to the townspeople, is hidden inside Musalla Gardens in northern Shiraz.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hafez (1315-1390), a poet</em></strong> from Shiraz, is regarded as one of the most famous and well-liked Persian poets of all time. He is Iran's Shakespeare; to Iranians, he is both a national hero and a prophet. His works are included in the well-known Dvn, read by Iranians of all ages. In reality, this book is a joint possession in Iranian households.</p>
<p>Today, a stunning dome decorated with beautiful mosaic tiles covers the Tomb of Hafez, located beneath an open pavilion. The encircling garden offers the ideal tranquil setting to appreciate this location's value and read some of Hafez's poetry if you're feeling moved.</p>
<p>Locals may be seen collecting outside the grave to pay their respects to this beloved poet, especially on October 12th, which is declared Hafez's National Day.</p>
<h2 class="h2">9. Vakil Mosque, Shiraz</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran12.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>The <strong><em>majestic Vakil Mosque</em></strong>, which is especially popular with photographers and lovers of architecture, is a must-see on every trip to Shiraz. Visitors can't discover many mosques in Iran that have an appearance like this one, which finished in 1773 under the Zand era. This mosque features 48 spiral pillars, which is a unique characteristic.</p>
<p>The Vakil Mosque is calmer than other Shiraz tourist sites and has a very tranquil atmosphere.</p>
<h2 class="h2">10. Maharloo Lake, Shiraz</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran13.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>The <strong><em>lovely Maharloo Lake</em></strong> is commonly referred to as the Pink Lake because of its salt water's significant amounts of red tides.</p>
<p>July through September are perfect for visiting this Salt Lake since more water from the lake is likely to evaporate during these months, increasing the pink colours. The lake is probably less pink during the wet season for the same reasons (April to June). It is unquestionably one of Iran's most beautiful sites.</p>
<h2 class="h2">11. Persepolis</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran14.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>Persepolis, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is located about 60 kilometres (37 miles) northeast of Shiraz.</p>
<p>One of the <strong><em>best activities in Iran</em></strong> is taking a day excursion to visit the historic ruins of this city. Anyone could feel relatively little and humbled by the great history of ancient Persia as you walk between the pillars, arches, and remnants of what once were magnificent palaces.</p>
<p>Around 518 BC, <strong><em>Darius I</em></strong> is thought to have begun work on Persepolis, which took over 120 years to construct. It was unusual for rulers during the period. Still, Darius, I was considered a very kind ruler who paid the building workers on schedule and treated them exceptionally well.</p>
<p>Persepolis' principal purpose is still unknown. However, it is believed to have been a vast ceremonial structure that is only used occasionally.</p>
<h2 class="h2">12. Naqsh-e Rostam</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran15.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p><strong><em>Naqsh-e Rostam, the royal tomb of the Achaemenid Empire</em></strong>, is about ten minutes from Persepolis. The four magnificent rock-cut tombs of ancient Persian rulers are here, given that it's so near Persepolis.</p>
<p>The identity of the King's burial inside the tombs continues to be controversial among historians; only one of them, <strong><em>Darius I, the builder of Persepolis</em></strong>, is known for definite; the other three are considered <strong><em>Darius II, Artaxerxes I, and Xerxes I</em></strong>. Carvings of the monarchs appear to be God-like and are carved into the rock cliffs above each tomb.</p>
<p>There may also be more sculptures showing the triumphs of the Achaemenid Empire. The most remarkable statue of them all, though, dates back so far that it appears to indicate utilized this location before Achaemenid Persia was even founded.</p>
<h2 class="h2">13. Rayen Castle</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran16.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>The world's <strong><em>second-largest adobe</em></strong> (utilized as a construction material in sun-dried mud) castle, the beautiful Rayen Castle, is an excellent place to begin your trip in Kerman. This magnificent building, constructed during the Sassanid era (224-651 AD), rises majestically out of the desert. You really must visit it while you are in Iran!</p>
<p>Despite its terrible tragedies, the castle has also been in excellent condition. It is believed that 5,000 people once stayed in this castle, and the modern building you see was constructed over the ruins of an earlier palace.</p>
<p>Three sections of Rayen Castle were designated for different groups; the monarchs, the lords and rich, and the ordinary. These regions were each divided by walls and towers.</p>
<p>The castle was ideally placed on a busy trade route, making it a well-liked gathering place for merchants and caravans. Additionally, there were numerous workshops where people worked on creating swords, knives, and weapons, and some of them are still visible today beside the entrance.</p>
<h2 class="h2">14. The Kaluts</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran17.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>The beautiful <strong><em>Dasht-e Lut, a salt desert</em></strong> recognized by UNESCO and home to some stunning clay-rock formations known as Kaluts, is undoubtedly the crown jewel of the Kerman region. To truly experience this location's magnificence, we strongly suggest staying here for the night and stargazing.</p>
<p>Rayen Castle is a convenient stop before continuing to the desert (roughly a 3-hour drive). If you get here in time, you may stay the night and experience the dawn of the Kaluts.</p>
<p>Strong winds and stream flow gave rise to the extraordinary and distinctive formations of the Kaluts. You can obtain a stunning view of the desert from the top of several rock formations, some of which are simple to climb.</p>
<h2 class="h2">15. Yazd Old Town</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran18.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>Yazd, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is <strong><em>one of the oldest cities</em></strong> on earth, and it is fantastic to spend at least two days seeing it. The best way to connect with this city is to walk through the Old Town, and its calm and relaxed atmosphere will pull visitors in immediately.</p>
<p>Yazd is known as the <strong><em>"City of Windcatchers,"</em></strong> The Old Town is full of wind towers, adobe homes, secret courtyards, magnificent mosques, roofs with breathtaking views, and mudbrick walls.</p>
<p>The Old Town is quite simple to get lost in; the numerous little streets will give you the impression that you're moving through a complex.</p>
<h2 class="h2">16. Amir Chakhmaq Complex, Yazd</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran19.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>The magnificent Amir Chakhmaq Complex is one of Yazd's Old Town's greatest treasures. In addition to a massive mosque, this square has a bathhouse, a tomb, and several cafes and eateries. Behind the square is a bazaar where you can purchase regional kebabs.</p>
<p>The square's tranquil surroundings will charm you over instantly, and it's a perfect spot to relax on a bench, observe people, and take in the stunning Amir Chakhmaq mosque. It was constructed in 1438 during the Timurid dynasty, is the square's primary focus and represents Yazd.</p>
<h2 class="h2">17. Bagh-E-Dolat Abad, Yazd</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran20.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>One of the nicest areas in Yazd is the Bagh-e Dolat Abad, a picturesque palace inside a UNESCO park. It was previously owned by <strong><em>Karim Khan Zand,</em></strong> who established the Zand dynasty and constructed it in 1750.</p>
<p>The pavilion's inside is captivating in every way. Large, vibrant stained-glass windows with a variety of patterns will delight you. Numerous local tourists may be seen there taking a picture. The garden is a fantastic spot to take a casual walk; it features a large pool encircled by trees and has a tranquil atmosphere.</p>
<h2 class="h2">18. Sar Yazd Castle</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran21.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>A castle made of adobe that rises out of the desert around 50 kilometres (31 miles) outside of Yazd is one of the <strong><em>top sites to visit in Iran</em></strong>. It takes around 50 minutes to get there by vehicle from Yazd Old Town.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of other tourists, seeing this ancient fortification is an authentic and genuine experience. Discovering peaceful passages, secret openings, and rooms that transport you back in time will make you feel like a simple explorer.</p>
<p>Sar Yazd Castle, constructed in the seventh century, served as Yazd's defence against assaults and invasions. There were also numerous food supplies, grain products, gold, and other goods.</p>
<p>It's relatively simple to get lost walking throughout the premises, which includes three stories and 450 rooms.</p>
<p>You'll feel as though you're lost in a jungle as you tour the castle. It is because the castle was explicitly constructed to be challenging for attackers to the entrance and navigate. It's a unique sensation to squeeze through the inside alleys, designed to hold just one individual at a time.</p>
<h2 class="h2">19. James Mosque, Yazd</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran22.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>The magnificent Jameh Mosque in Yazd, built in the 12th century and still used today, is one of the city's must-see attractions. Besides its stunning entry entrance, many more aspects of this mosque will astonish you.</p>
<p>This structure is surrounded by two minarets, the tallest in Iran at 52 meters (170 feet). The prayer hall interior features even more gorgeous mosaic tiles, and its top is decorated with fantastic artwork.</p>
<p>This mosque is a work of architecture and a haven for individuals who admire elaborate tilework. This magnificent building is also represented on the front of the 200-rial Iranian banknote.</p>
<h2 class="h2">20. Zoroastrian Towers of Silence, Yazd</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran23.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>Nearly 11 kilometres (6.8 miles) from the mosques and adobe dwellings of Yazd Old Town lies another area rich in history and culture. Until 40 years ago, Zoroastrians (a follower of a pre-Islamic religion in Iran) conducted their sky burial ceremonies at the Towers of Silence, also known as dakhmas.</p>
<p>Zoroastrians thought that when people died, their bodies may be defiled by demons and become unclean. Therefore, according to their custom, they would purify the dead by placing them on top of the Towers of Silence in three concentric rounds. The bodies will then steadily rot while being eaten by vultures in the desert. The bones were transported into the towers' ossuaries.</p>
<p>These towers were prohibited in Iran in the 1970s; therefore, Zoroastrians had to adopt different burial customs, even though this custom dates back to the early ninth century AD.</p>
<p>These towers are still standing today and are placed on little hills. It's a fantastic location to learn about the Zoroastrian community's customs.</p>
<h2 class="h2">21. Khaju Bridge, Isfahan</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran24.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>In the evening, one of the most soothing things to do in Isfahan is to visit the lovely Khaju Bridge. This historic bridge shines brilliantly in the nighttime, spreading a wonderfully serene and pleasant atmosphere.</p>
<p>The fact that it's a favourite gathering area for families and teenagers makes it the ideal location for photography and offering a glimpse into Iranian culture.</p>
<p>Shah Abbas II, the seventh Safavid king, spent out in the pavilion in the middle of the bridge to take in the splendour of the Zayanderud River below. The bridge is also decorated with exquisite tilework and paintings.</p>
<p>However, the primary reason to go here is to enjoy the beautiful Persian music that local singers under the bridge play in the evenings.</p>
<h2 class="h2">22. Mollabashi House, Isfahan</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran25.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>The beautiful Mollabashi House is commonly referred to as the <strong><em>Motamedi House</em></strong>, and it is the most breathtaking medieval palace. This home accurately represents how wealthy Iranians lived throughout the Zand (1751-1779) and Qajar (1789- 1925) eras.</p>
<p>The Motamedi family, who bought the property in 2000 and spent seven years repairing it, is responsible for much of what visitors see now. The Motamedi family was the famed 19th-century astronomer of the Shah and had resided in this home.</p>
<p>The exquisite features and patterns that decorate this old house's rooms and courtyards make for hours of enjoyment. One of the most breathtaking views in Iran is the beautiful guest room, so be sure to visit during the day to enjoy the stunning colours and lights emanating from the stained-glass windows.</p>
<p>It's truly a one-of-a-kind experience to explore this old home. The most significant part is that hardly many people come here, so you get to virtually have the mirror-finished walls, stucco accents, and elaborate ceilings to yourself.</p>
<h2 class="h2">23. Ali Qapu Palace, Isfahan</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran26.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>Ali Qapu Palace<strong><em>, a magnificent UNESCO site</em></strong> and the official palace of the Safavid rulers, is situated just across from Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque. This palace, which was constructed in 1597, has six stories, each of which is attached by a staircase.</p>
<p>There are many unique floral paintings and artwork inside, and you'll also receive a fascinating look at the royal families' daily lives in the past. The Music Hall's beautiful stucco decoration on the upper floor, however, is the focal point of the building. Many singers and groups have performed there, and the ceiling is painted with vases to improve the sound.</p>
<p>From the palace's terrace, you can also enjoy a fantastic view of Naqsh-e Jahan Square and the Shah Mosque and marvel at the fact that, almost 400 years ago, the Safavid rulers gathered there to watch horse races and Chowgan, a traditional Iranian horseback team effort.</p>
<h2 class="h2">24. Naqsh-e Jahan Square, Isfahan</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran27.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>Spending some time at the <strong><em>majestic Naqsh-e Jahan Square</em></strong>, the city's centre, is the ideal place to begin visiting Isfahan. Isfahan's beauty is perfectly captured in this UNESCO-designated square. It is one of the biggest squares in the world and was constructed in 1602 during the Safavid dynasty.</p>
<p>The environment in the square is just excellent; the gardens and fountains in the centre express tranquillity and serenity, while the bazaars on the sides are bustling with activity.</p>
<p>Finally, you'll be astounded by the mosques and mansions surrounding the area. You may easily spend a whole day in Naqsh-e Jahan Square, which is undoubtedly one of Iran's most picturesque locations.</p>
<h2 class="h2">25. Shah Mosque, Isfahan</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran28.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>The stunning Shah Mosque, also called the <strong><em>Imam Mosque</em></strong>, is located inside Naqsh-e Jahan Square and is arguably the most beautiful building there. You will be in awe of its unique multicoloured mosaic tiles. One of the finest works of the Safavid dynasty, this 1629-completed UNESCO mosque is regarded as the peak of Persian Islamic architecture (1501 - 1736).</p>
<p>Simply appreciating the tilework features on the entrance gate might keep one busy for hours. Once you enter, more beautiful scripts and designs will catch your eye, and it's undoubtedly among the most remarkable things you'll see.</p>
<p>An important acoustic point of the mosque is marked by a stone on the ground beneath the mosque's central dome. The sound continues to resound throughout the surrounding portions of the mosque, allowing the speaker to talk while being audible to everyone there.</p>
<h2 class="h2">26. Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque, Isfahan</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran29.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque, another <strong><em>magnificent example of Safavid architecture</em></strong>, is another fantastic site to see inside Naqsh-e Jahan Square. This mosque, which took 25 years to construct and was completed in 1619, is claimed to have been more beautiful and high-quality than ever built in Iran.</p>
<p>This mosque was once mainly open to royalty; in fact, it was kept off-limits to the general public for centuries. There are rumours that Shah Abbas, the ruler at the time, had a tunnel constructed from Ali Qapu Palace to this mosque because then the women in his harem could enter without being seen by the general population.</p>
<h2 class="h2">27. Vank Cathedral, Isfahan</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran30.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>The magnificent Vank Cathedral is <strong><em>a fantastic location</em></strong> to discover more about Isfahan's history. Shah Abbas ordered 150,000 Armenian merchants and artisans to leave their nation and work for the Persian Empire at the start of the 17th century. Vank Cathedral was shortly constructed there for the Armenian population in Isfahan after he established the New Julfa Armenian community.</p>
<p>The interior is stunning, with a distinctive fusion of lavish paintings, golden sculptures, and detailed tilework. Seeing how these elements combine Islamic and Armenian architectural forms captivatingly is impressive.</p>
<h2 class="h2">28. Chehel Sotoun, Isfahan</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran31.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>The magnificent Chehel Sotoun is a 17th-century building located at the other end of a large pool in the Chehel Sotoun Garden, which is included on the UNESCO World Heritage List. <strong><em>Shah Abbas II</em></strong> constructed it as a venue for celebrations, gatherings, and ceremonies (such as coronations).</p>
<p>This palace is a heaven for lovers of architecture and photography in contrast to being <strong><em>a fantastic location</em></strong> to step back in time and understand the history of the Safavid period in Iran.</p>
<p>The nearby garden is a beautiful location for a tranquil and soothing wander. The Chehel Sotoun palace's interior is elaborately decorated with gorgeous paintings and decorations, some of which represent wars fought by the Safavid Shahs to illustrate their superiority.</p>
<p>Additionally, the ceilings have charming geometrical designs and artwork. This palace has an intriguing exterior as well. The building is held by 20 wooden pillars, which appear to be 40 because they appear to be reflected in the large pool in front of the structure.</p>
<h2 class="h2">29. Chahar bagh Street, Isfahan</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran32.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>The Safavid Dynasty is represented by the famous <strong><em>Chahar Bagh Boulevard or Street</em></strong> in the centre of Isfahan. In this area of the city, there are several other significant monuments.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the King and his family's favourite location in the town was this collection of regal buildings. Due to the lovely trees and pathways that have been constructed, it is still a trendy location for everyone. Stores are constantly bustling.</p>
<p>The riverfront is located at the end of Chahar Bagh Abbasi Street, and many people are trying to cross the road to reach the riverside by wandering down the street. Chahar Bagh, "Four Gardens," was chosen to highlight the area's splendour.</p>
<h2 class="h2">30. Jameh Mosque, Isfahan</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran33.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>The Jameh Mosque, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is located in Isfahan and is the <strong><em>country's oldest Friday mosque</em></strong>. This mosque was most likely constructed in the eighth century and began its life as a Zoroastrian temple; however, no one is certain of its exact creation date.</p>
<p>Jameh Mosque was originally just an adobe building. Still, today it is elaborate with painted tilework and muqarnas (a picture of how God created everything, symbolically), primarily because of the Safavid era's aesthetic improvements.</p>
<p>The wonderful thing about this mosque is that you'll see that the architecture is different when you explore the many chambers. Throughout the 12 century, this mosque received several remodellings and reconstructions by various rulers.</p>
<p>You may discover a lot about the historical development of Iranian architecture by exploring the complex. Additionally, you'll witness many creative elements showing how Islamic art has changed over the last 1,000 years.</p>
<h2 class="h2">31. Sultan Amir Ahamad Bathhouse, Kashan</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran34.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>Discover one of the <strong><em>most magnificent bathhouses</em></strong> in the nation when you first arrive in Kashan. The Sultan Amir Ahmad Bathhouse, a model old Persian bathhouse from the 16th century, provides a fascinating look into early local life.</p>
<p>For Iranians, taking a bath was more than simply a fast wash; it was a lengthy and significant process. People would gather at bathhouses to unwind, mingle, and even pray. It still plays a vital role in Iranian society today.</p>
<p>You'll be fascinated as you enter Sultan Amir Ahmad Bathhouse by the magnificent decoration on the walls and ceilings. All around you are stunning artwork, turquoise tiles, and vivid patterns.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran35.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>Perhaps even more fascinating is how the bathhouse looks from the outside. The roof of the bathhouse is made up of several domes with convex windows that let light into the building.</p>
<p>We found the most relaxing and tranquil atmosphere here. When you wait for the occasional tour group to go, the bathhouse becomes almost entirely silent, giving you perfect privacy to enjoy one of ancient Persia's most outstanding architectural achievements.</p>
<h2 class="h2">32. Agha Bozarg Mosque, Kashan</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran36.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>The Agha Bozorg Mosque, built <strong><em>in the 18th century</em></strong>, is much more straightforward in style than most other prominent mosques in Iran. It is not as elaborately decorated as the Pink Mosque in Shiraz or the Shah Mosque in Isfahan.</p>
<p>This mosque was the <strong><em>favourite location in Iran,</em></strong> mainly due to its simple exterior, charming architectural elegance, and the overwhelming sense of tranquillity it creates. It improved the experience because there were not nearly as many visitors as at most other well-known Iranian mosques.</p>
<p>The gorgeous underground courtyard of this mosque also serves as a madrasa, and you can see several student rooms within. This location is frequented by many local families, which contributes to the lively and relaxed environment.</p>
<h2 class="h2">33. Kashan Bazaar</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran37.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>Besides being <strong><em>a fantastic destination to buy gifts</em></strong>, Iran's renowned Kashan Bazaar is also home to some of its most beautiful cultural and architectural landmarks. It is excellent, clear, and encircled by a domed ceiling that exhibits some unique multicoloured patterns and decorations; it is a fantastic sight.</p>
<p>There are many spots to stay beneath the dome and enjoy people-watching. In addition to the pleasant atmosphere, a neighbourhood tea shop is nearby if you wish to taste some Persian tea.</p>
<p>Since over 800 years ago, the bazaar has served as Kashan's main commercial area. Despite its rows of bustling shops, the bazaar also features several tiny mosques, madrasas (Islamic schools), and bathhouses. The stores provide various goods, including fruits, spices, and handicrafts.</p>
<h2 class="h2">34. Fin Garden, Kashan</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran38.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p><strong><em>A fantastic location for a lovely walk is the old Fin Garden.</em></strong> One of the oldest gardens in the nation, it was constructed in 1590 and once served as a resting place for the Shahs. It also has a slightly scary past; the Shah killed a former Iranian chancellor at the Fin Bath inside this park. That location is still easily accessible.</p>
<p>Fin Garden now has many fruit trees, ponds, fountains, blooms, canals, and magnificent architecture like most Iranian tourist destinations. In reality, the complex's architecture is a spectacular combination of Safavid, Zand, and Qajar era designs, and the structure in the centre features a gorgeous dome decorated with colourful patterns.</p>
<h2 class="h2">35. The Historical Houses of Kashaz</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran39.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>Kashan is renowned for its <strong><em>magnificent traditional homes</em></strong> from the 18th and 19th centuries, which provide a fascinating look into how affluent families used to live in the past. The Tabatabaei House, Abbasi House, Borujerdi House, and Ameriha House are some of the most remarkable historical residences that must explore during a stay in this city.</p>
<p>These homes are divided into interior and outdoor areas, with the indoor space set aside for family members. Each feature several gardens and courtyards, and some houses even have between 40 and 80 rooms. Inside these homes, you'll find some genuinely excellent decorations, including delicate glasswork, mirror work, stucco, frescoes, and a large variety of vivid stained-glass windows.</p>
<h2 class="h2">36. Mohammaed Helal Shirine, Aran va Bidgol</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran40.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>Mohammed Helal Shrine, also known as the <strong><em>Shrine of Hilal ibn Ali</em></strong>, is a stunning hidden gem that most tourists are unaware of and is only a 20-minute drive from the centre of Kashan.</p>
<p>It is one of Iran's most stunning locations. Also exceptionally pleasant, the staff members of this temple will be offering to show you around.</p>
<p>This shrine presents some genuine masterpieces of Islamic architecture, including sparkling minarets, a huge blue-tiled dome, and beautiful mosaic tiles. Once inside, it's essentially wholly silent, and you can see a few people praying.</p>
<h2 class="h2">37. Abyaneh Village</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran41.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>One of Iran's oldest villages is called Abyaneh. Due to the magnificent collection of red clay houses that make up this 2,500-year-old community, it is often called the <strong><em>"Red Village."</em></strong></p>
<p>This village's local culture, language, architecture, and clothing have maintained the test of many centuries and dynasties and have been recognized by UNESCO as exceptionally well-kept.</p>
<p>The best thing to do in Abyaneh is to wander around the village's narrow alleys. That way, you'll discover the most significant beauty, and practically every turn is picturesque. You may climb the stairs to the rooftops of some red houses, where you'll be given a breathtaking view of the Karkas Mountains.</p>
<h2 class="h2">38. Kish Island</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran42.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>Kish Island is one of the islands in the Persian Gulf. This <strong><em>lovely island</em></strong> is unlike other regions of Iran. The lifestyle is a combination of Iranian and Arabic. Most local occupations are sea-related, and the island's business has changed significantly over the years.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Greek Ship</em></strong> is one of the things you can do there, along with the <strong><em>Kish Dolphin Park and Maryam beach</em></strong>. You can enjoy numerous additional things and spots you can visit when you arrive. Iran is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. The best times to visit Kish are winter and fall because the island is hot in the summer.</p>
<p>On this island, nature is also incredibly unique. People can visit the area by the sea and engage in other adventure activities. You must try swimming and snorkeling in the beautiful Persian Gulf water.</p>
<h2 class="h2">39. Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran43.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>An ideal place to begin a trip through time is the Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System. The area mentioned was crucial to a civilization's water supply system around 3000 years ago. <strong><em>This water supply system is considered a unique masterpiece of Darius the Great</em></strong>, a creative genius who ruled over all of Iran for around 30 years.</p>
<p>The Shushtar infrastructure supports thirteen historic sites. This attractive location includes waterfalls, watermills, clean tunnels for transporting drinking water, and historic bridges. You may interact with an innovative complex that dates back thousands of years before any modern system.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran44.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>In one of Iran's southwest provinces, Khuzestan, SHHS is situated beside a branch of the Karun River. Visitors arrive at SHHS after travelling through many roads lined with sunflower and rice fields.</p>
<p>Visiting this fantastic location brings back memories of earlier times when people attempted to determine the most effective uses of their intellect. This history is one of Iran's top tourist destinations and a source of inspiration for Iranians.</p>
<h2 class="h2">40. North of Iran</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tourist-places/images/tourist-places-in-iran45.png" alt="Tourist Places in Iran" />
<p>A collection of cities are referred to as <strong><em>"North"</em></strong> by Iranians. Iran's northern region is, in fact, its paradise. A vast area near the Caspian Sea with countless tourist destinations and attractions. The primary interests in this region of the nation are the stunning scenery and beaches. There are several cities in Iran's north, and each town has its style, culture, and tourist attractions.</p>
<p>These towns' woods and the Caspian Sea draw a lot of tourists each year, and the trip is usually enjoyable. <strong><em>Masooleh</em></strong> is one of the most well-known cities in Iran's northern cities. All of the homes in Masooleh are built in a distinctive architectural style that surpasses one another.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The number of distinctive locations and things to do in Iran makes it impossible to include all its top tourist places. Iran is a sizable nation with a diverse population and different natural landscapes, and these mentioned factors represent Iran's prosperous tourist industry.</p>
