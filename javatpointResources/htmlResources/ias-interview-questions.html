<h1 class="h1">IAS Interview Questions</h1>
<p>IAS stands for <strong>Indian Administrative Service</strong>. IAS's candidates are selected by a central level examination conducted by the <strong>Union Public Service Commission</strong> (UPSC). It is considered one of the toughest government exams in the country. This exam consists of three parts: Prelims, Mains and then Interview. The interview part of the UPSC examination is the most critical. It ensures you get the best service and can also play a critical role in the final selection.</p>
<p>IAS Prelims and Main examinations are conducted to test the candidates' academic and general awareness (Along with a diverse range of topics). On the other hand, the IAS Interview test is the civil services candidate's personality and temperament test.</p>
<h2 class="h2">The UPSC examination Pattern</h2>
<p>To become an IAS, the candidate has to face and clear the following three exams:</p>
<p><strong>Prelims:</strong> This is the first exam, and the paper has objective type questions. It is a very tough examination as its questions are neither repeated nor copied from any reference books. Besides this, the probability of each question has an equal probability of 1/4 of getting correct.</p>
<p><strong>Mains:</strong> This is the second paper and is a subjective type. The candidates who get selected in prelims appear for mains. In this paper, the candidate's way of writing and presentation of knowledge is checked. In this paper, the candidate has to show his knowledge by writing the answers in detail.</p>
<p><strong>Interview:</strong> This is the third stage of the examination. If the candidate gets selected in mains too, he has to appear for the interview. The interviewers, in the interview, are senior IAS officers. They ask the candidate every such question which he/ she has not studied in a textbook.</p>
<p>The following personality traits are checked in this interview test:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Mental alertness</li>
<li>Critical powers of assimilation</li>
<li>Clear and logical exposition</li>
<li>Social traits</li>
<li>Interest and knowledge of current affairs</li>
<li>Balance of judgment</li>
<li>Variety and depth of interest</li>
<li>The ability for social cohesion</li>
<li>Leadership skills</li>
<li>Intellectual and moral integrity</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2">Common Interview Questions and Assessment</h2>
<p>When you get qualified in the prelims and mains examination, you call for a personality test or interview test. In this test, the UPSC panel members can ask questions related to your detailed application form.</p>
<p>The questions can be asked on your place of birth, interest, issues related to your home state, current national issues, and more.</p>
<p>For example, if you are from Uttar Pradesh or Bihar, you can face questions related to politics. If you belong to some famous tourist place, a member can ask, what is your city famous for? What is the name of the famous places in your city? The candidates' hobbies and areas of interest also play an important role during the interview. If your hobby is gardening, you will surely get some questions about soil, vegetables, herbs etc. Besides this, if you have any prior job expression, the questions related to that job can be asked.</p>
<p>For example, if you have worked as an engineer, you could be asked about technology, innovation, job profile, etc. While you answer these questions, the members of the panel observe how you respond to each question.</p>
<p>During this session, the panel tries to assess whether your answers suit the Indian national or a regional mindset.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Situational Interview Questions</h2>
<p>The interview panel can also create questions according to certain situations and asked to you. For example, they may give a situation like an earthquake, fire burst, floods and ask the candidate to respond to it in a district collector's role. Members might also ask tricky questions.</p>
<p>These situational and tricky questions are asked to evaluate the candidates' mental alertness and the ability to think logically in a crisis.</p>

<hr />
<h2 class="h2padding">Questions Generally asked by the Interview Panel</h2>
<h3 class="h3">1) Why do you want to join the civil services? / Why do you want to join the civil services if you can do well by doing social work?</h3>
<p>This fact cannot be ignored that most of the candidates dream of becoming an IAS officer due to certain emotionally driven reasons. You can say that it is one of the most prestigious government jobs in our country. We all know that an IAS officer is endowed with unmatched power. Even a state government cannot take action against IAS officials without taking permission from MHRD. Apart from being an attractive career option and benefits such as a good package and job security, civil services offer a platform for a candidate to serve the country at different levels, work for the underprivileged's welfare, and contribute towards the nation's development. But, it would help if you did not answer in such a simple and straightforward way. Your answer must be diplomatic and suits all the aspects.</p>
<p><strong>Your answer should be like:</strong></p>
<blockquote>My basic reason of entering into civil services is to serve the nation, serve the people and to bring positive changes in the society.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Sir my main motive to join the civil services is to positively affect the lives of thousands of people in and around my region. I well know that an IAS officer is responsible for regulations of policies, developmental activities and also, the administration. He can play an important role in handling administrative affairs of both central and state governments and may also lead government ministries, higher departments, and important socio-economic institution of our country and may represent our nation at international, bilateral or multilateral platforms.</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">2) Why do you want to join civil services even though the salary is limited?</h3>
<p>This is a very tough and tricky question. This is not a type of question that has a fix and exact answer. The answer to this question can be varied from person to person. No two aspirants will give the same answer.</p>
<p>However, you can answer this question by serving the nation, power and prestige associated with this job, being in a leadership position, various assignments, etc.</p>
<p><strong>You can answer this as follow:</strong></p>
<p>IAS as a job I believe is best in India. This is a job where you don't think about salary. This job provides opportunities to serve in leadership and key positions in government. India is a developing and welfare-oriented nation, And IAS are involved in the formulation and implementation of national policies, which gives an IAS officer ample opportunity to problem-solving, innovating, and bringing ideas to life. Moreover, professional growth in IAS is rapid. They get a chance to serve in various departments of government. This variety of assignments and rapid professional growth and are enough for high job satisfaction for me.</p>
<p>Last but not least, IAS's prestige and pride are also a reason I want to join IAS.</p>
<p><strong>Another Ans:</strong> Everyone who prepares for this examination has some thinking and mindset about civil services or IAS. You can tell yours to the interview panel very clearly and in a very straightforward manner.</p>
<p>Don't try to impress the interview panel by telling lies and boasting stuff like:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>I will remove corruption.</li>
<li>I will make India the best of the best country.</li>
<li>IAS can give me power, so I will make everything correct wherever I will be posted.</li>
<li>I will eradicate poverty.</li>
</ul>
<p>See, these statements are vague. You will get bashed in the interview if you won't be able to put up the fact and give back your statement logically.</p>
<p>So, you should always say meaningful things and always be ready to follow up questions.</p>
<p>If you don't know anything, then you can say I don't know.</p>
<p>Saying irrelevant things will lead one thing to another, and you will end up with a bad interview experience. They are really smart folks. Be simple nice genuine, and speak clearly.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">3) What is special about your date of birth? Any important event took place that year?</h3>
<p>To answer this question, you must tell the historical or any other special facts associated with that date. For example, suppose you were born on <strong>23rd April 1992.</strong> Then you can say that-</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>On 23rd April 1992</strong>, India's most eminent filmmaker Satyajit Ray dies, leaving a huge void in Indian cinema, which is yet to be filled. He was the only filmmaker from India to win an Oscar.</li>
<li><strong>On 23rd April 1564</strong>, the great English poet William Shakespeare was born. He also died on his birthday on 23rd April in the year 1616.</li>
<li><strong>On 23rd April 1972,</strong> Apollo 16 astronauts (John W. Young, Thomas K Mattingly II, Charles M. Duke Jr.) explores Moon's surface.</li>
<li><strong>On 23rd April 1920,</strong> the Ottoman Empire in Turkey ended.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of such facts that you can tell the interview board.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">4) What is your ambition or aim in life?</h3>
<p>The definition of ambition or aim is a motivation or a strong urge to achieve something. If this question is asked in the UPSC interview, then you have already achieved a big goal that you have set for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>You can answer like:</strong> "My ambition in life is to become a good officer who feel the pain of their citizen and try to solve their problems as much as possible. I want to take part in nation building through this great profession. I believe in the fact that everything is possible in the life with hard work and positive attitude, and I shall prove it true."</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">5) You have opted for arts subjects in UPSC when you are an engineer. Why did you choose that subject?</h3>
<p>According to the recent trends, most engineering graduates choose their optional from humanities subjects in UPSC exams. The percentage of engineers is growing year by year who crack the UPSC exams. Engineering students crack the UPSC exam because of the practical pedagogical methods in their four-year engineering studies. This provides them with a better analytical aptitude as compared to Arts graduates.</p>
<p>Another big reason is that the brightest students in school are encouraged to take up Engineering or Medicine, and this is the same cadre of applicants that appear for UPSC. Because of these fields' very nature, engineering students understand competitive exams better than the Arts graduates.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">6) How can I select my subjects in UPSC if I am from an engineering background?</h3>
<p>The subject selection for the UPSC exam depends on your choice. It doesn't matter from which background you are. For the civil service exam (IAS/IFS/IPS), you have to choose only one optional, and for IFoS, you have to choose 2. If you are an engineering graduate, Mathematics will be a good optional for which you might have the pre-requisite knowledge. But you should select Mathematics only if you have an interest in that subject. Always remember that coaching for Mathematics is not widely available compared to other subjects. If you think you can prepare the subject by yourself only then opt for it.</p>
<p>If you don't feel confident in Mathematics, you should focus on the big four art subjects (History, Geography, Polity, and Economics).</p>
<p>Select one subject you find interesting, and feel the confidence you can write the answers, refer to previous year question papers. The biggest advantages of these subjects are that you can find many trainers and study materials who can guide you. Find someone who can guide you. It can be any coaching institute or anyone from your friends or family.</p>
<p>Besides these subjects, Public Administration is also a good choice. Don't go for engineering subjects like Mechanical, Civil or Electrical if you don't feel confident. These subjects are lengthy, took a lot of time.</p>
<h4 class="n">Note: Choose your optional only on your interest. Remember your optional subject is a very crucial factor to get you in the final list.</h4>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">7) How to choose the optional subject for UPSC Civil Services Exam?</h3>
<p>Many aspects should be kept in mind while choosing an Optional Subject for the UPSC exam:</p>
<p><strong>1. Interest and academic background of the aspirant</strong></p>
<p>Before choosing your Optional, you should identify your interest in a subject. Go through school level NCERT's (Class 11th and 12th preferably), and check the Optional subject syllabus and your comfort level in reading the subject.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> If you are from the Commerce background, look for what you have already studied in college and choose accordingly between Commerce, Management or Public Administration.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> If you are from an Engineering background, check the syllabus and content of optional subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Engineering optional - Civil, Electrical, Mechanical etc. If you are not comfortable with the science subjects mentioned, check other optional subjects such as Geography, Psychology, Anthropology, Political Science, Sociology, Public Administration, Philosophy etc.</p>
<p><strong>2. Coaching and Trainers available for the subject</strong></p>
<p>You can talk to your seniors, friends, and civil servants who have already qualified to identify the best coaching classes available in your city. Study material from good coaching, along with the classes conducted, can accelerate your preparation.</p>
<p><strong>3. Contribution of the Optional Subject towards General Study syllabus</strong></p>
<p>This point is very important, and that's why many aspirants take humanities subjects as their optional because they cover a good part of the general study.</p>
<p><strong>4. Performance of the optional subject in the recent past (at least past three years)</strong></p>
<p>The individual performance of a candidate can vary on a large number of parameters compared to his competitors. You can find that some optional subjects do not fetch the marks desired compared to the effort put in by candidates. You should avoid those subjects.</p>
<p><strong>5. Time Management</strong></p>
<p>Time management is the biggest factor to be selected in the UPSC exam. The candidate should decide how much time he/she would spend studying an Optional Subject. A few candidates might be working while preparing or studying at a university. They should choose optional by estimating the amount of time required to study the chosen optional subject and General Studies.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The objective of asking this question is to check the presence of the candidate's mind.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">17) What will you do if I run away with your sister?</h3>
<p>Obviously, I would be thrilled because you are a well-qualified man, and it would be an excellent match for my sister. I won't get angry because it would be challenging for me to find a better match for my sister than you.</p>

<h3 class="h3">18) This is an equation you have to solve: ( ) + ( ) + ( ) + ( ) + ( ) = 30. The following are the numbers that you can use to fill in the brackets: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15. You can repeat the numbers if required. The resulting sum should be 30 only.</h3>
<p>This is a tricky math question that can take a lot of time if you are not prepared well. The objective of asking this question is to test your thinking ability and aptitude.</p>
<p>In the above question, there is no mention if you can use mathematical signs or not. So, here we shall use the plus and minus mathematical signs in the brackets to solve this equation. This is the only possible way to solve this. This would be solved as follows: (15 - 9) + (13 - 7) + (7 - 1) + (9 - 1) + (13 - 9). When you solve inside the brackets, you will get the following equation 6 + 6 + 6 + 8 + 4 = 30</p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> We know that 365 days in a year usually (366 days in a leap year which falls after every four years). There are 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour. So, our answer would be 24*60*365. It seems a straightforward question, but it has also been asked in the UPSC interview.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">20) Alex looked at his reflection on the window mirror of the 35th floor. Driven by an irrational impulse, he leaped through the window on the other side. Yet Alex did not encounter even a single bruise. How can this be possible if he did neither land on a soft surface nor used a parachute? </h3>
<p>Alex is a window cleaner who was tired after cleaning the windows on the 35th floor and then leaped inside the building.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The objective of asking this question is to check the presence of the candidate's mind.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">21) Suppose you have a scooter that has two tires and one stepni (spare tire). Each tire can run 50 km. How long can a scooter run?</h3>
<p>The scooter has three tires, and each tire can run 50 kilometers, then the total distance they can cover is 150 km. However, at any time, we need 2 tires. Hence, the total maximum distance that you can cover by your scooter is = 150/2 = 75 kilometers.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Let's see how the maximum distance would be achieved. Let the three tires be A, B, and C.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The total distance covered on tires A and B would be 25 kilometers (remaining: tire A capacity = 25 km, tire B capacity B = 25 km, tire C capacity = 50 km)</li>
<li>The total distance covered on tires B and C would be 25 kilometers (remaining: tire A capacity = 25 km, tire B capacity = 0 km, tyre C capacity = 25 km)</li>
<li>The total distance covered on tires A and C would be 25 kilometers (remaining: tire B capacity = 0 km, tire B capacity B = 0 km, tire C capacity = 0 km).</li>
</ul>
<p>The total distance covered is: 25+25+25 = 75 km.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Generally, a candidate answers this with 'Coffee'; however, the panelist had ordered the coffee only to create the scenario whereby he could invoke this question. This question needs some innovative thinking. According to the alphabet, the perfect answer to this question would be to completely ignore the coffee and answer this question. The candidate, who got selected, said 'Tea' is in front of me and explained that the alphabet 'T' comes before 'U' and therefore T is before U.</p>
<hr />

<hr />
<h3 class="h3">26) What is the difference between vision, mission, goals, and objectives?</h3>

<p>The mission is a general statement of how you will achieve your vision. For example, the strategies that are used to reach the vision are called mission. The mission can be, use of technology for better delivery of services, climate-friendly mission, poverty elimination mission, etc. Goals are the statements of what needs to be accomplished to implement the strategy, and the objectives are specific actions and timelines for achieving the goal.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">27) How can you write 23 using only 2?</h3>
<p>We can easily write 23 using only 2. The answer would be 22 + 2/2 = 22 + 1 = 23</p>

<h3 class="h3">28) A farmer has some chickens and goats. If everyone has 90 heads and 224 legs, then what will be the number of goats?</h3>
<p>There will be 22 goats.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Let number of chickens be x and number of goats be y</p>
<p>According to the question,</p>
<p>x+y= 90</p>
<p>2 x + 4 y = 224 [As chickens have 2 legs and goat as 4 legs ]</p>
<p>2(x+y=90)</p>
<p>2 x + 4 y = 224</p>
<p>2 x + 2 y = 180</p>
<p>By subtracting we get 2 y = 44</p>
<p>So, y = 22</p>
<p>Therefore, number goats is 22</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">29) Which shopkeeper takes your goods as well as your money? </h3>

<h3 class="h3">2) Where would Lord Rama have celebrated his "First Diwali"?</h3>
<p>This is a very tricky question, as it requires both academic knowledge and practical knowledge of things. Generally, people say that Lord Rama may have celebrated his first Diwali at Ayodya as Ayodhya's citizens welcomed him after coming from a long 14 years of exile but if you see the history, Diwali was celebrated as a mark of Lord Krishna Killing Narakasura. In Dusavataar, Krishnavathaar comes after Raamavathaar. In other words, the celebration of Diwali started after Raamavathaar, and therefore, Lord Rama would not have celebrated Diwali At all. </p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">3) Which Indian temple disappears twice a day?</h3>
<p>Stambheshwar Mahadev Temple disappears twice a day. It is an ancient temple of Lord Shiva and also one of the oldest shrines in India. This temple is known for vanishing and reappearing twice during the day.</p>
<p>The Stambheshwar Mahadev Temple is located in the Kavi Kamboi village in Jambusar, Gujarat. It is located a few meters away from the seashore. So, during high tide, it submerges and, in low tide, reappears. Since the sea level rises twice during the day, the temple vanishes and emerges when the water recedes.</p>
<hr />

<hr />

<h2 class="h2padding">How to prepare yourself for the Interview?</h2>
<p>The UPSC interview process is used to check the candidate's mental ability, general awareness, social etiquette, and overall personality.

<li>Don't take stress on the day before the Interview. Took a good nap, rest well and be calm.</li>
