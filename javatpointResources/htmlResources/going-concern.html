<h1 class="h1">Going Concern</h1>
<p>The term "going concern" comes from the accounting industry and refers to a company's capacity to maintain its business operations in the foreseeable future. It is essential for investors to have a solid understanding of this concept since having such knowledge may assist them in making an informed decision about the firms in which they invest their money. This article will define going concern, discuss its importance, and explain how being aware of this concept may assist investors in making informed decisions about future investments.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/business/images/going-concern.png" alt="Going Concern" />
<h2 class="h2">What Does "Going Concern" Mean?</h2>
<p>When creating their financial accounts, businesses need to take into consideration one of the most important accounting concepts, which is the "<strong>going concern</strong>." According to the concept of a going concern, a business entity will keep continuing its activities into the <strong>foreseeable future</strong> and will not be forced to stop those operations for any reason or face the possibility of <strong>being liquidated</strong>. This concept has an impact on how businesses present their financial status, including their assets, liabilities, income, expenditure, cash flows, and other elements on their balance sheets. It also sets the standards for figuring out if a corporation has adequate liquidity to meet its obligations throughout the course of the next <strong>12 months or longer</strong> without help from outside sources.</p>
<p>The concept of "going concern" was designed to give stakeholders with information regarding a company's capacity to continue operating in the foreseeable future. It shows investors how a company is doing financially right now, so they can figure out what risks might be involved in investing in that company. When creating their financial reports, businesses are required to adhere to this guideline so that stakeholders may make educated judgments about whether or not they should invest in the company.</p>
<h2 class="h2">What Does a Financial Auditor Do?</h2>
<p>In the world of business, one of the most crucial jobs is that of a financial auditor, particularly when it comes to determining whether or not a firm will continue to operate or not. A <strong>financial audit</strong> is an investigation of a business's financial records(obtained from management) and accounts by an independent third party to determine whether or not they are accurate and in accordance with regulatory requirements. In particular, when it comes to evaluating going concerns, auditors will <strong>analyze the business's history, management strategy and structure</strong>, as well as its <strong>present financial status</strong>, in order to establish whether or not the firm is financially sustainable over the long term.</p>
<p>Following the completion of a thorough investigation (the audit) of the company's financial records, the auditor will provide a report that contains their assessment. The reports are as follows.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Unqualified Opinion</h3>
<p>When doing an audit on a company's financial accounts, a professional auditor will issue an <strong>unqualified opinion</strong> if they arrive at a <strong>favourable conclusion</strong>. It is sometimes referred to as a "<strong>clean opinion</strong>," and it means that no problems have been found throughout the auditing process and that the financial accounts are accurate and honest.</p>
<p>Unqualified opinions are extremely helpful to <strong>shareholders and investors</strong> because they provide them with the confidence that the company's finances are in order and that any risks associated with investing may be eliminated. This makes unqualified opinions an exceptionally valuable asset. In order for the auditor to have sufficient faith in being able to provide an opinion of this kind, they will have to investigate aspects such as the <strong>going concern, liquidity, the accuracy of the information contained in reports, and internal controls.</strong></p>
<h3 class="h3">Qualified Opinion</h3>
<p>When an auditor has <strong>concerns</strong> over a company's capacity to continue operations in the foreseeable future, they will issue what is known as a <strong>qualified opinion</strong>. This sort of opinion indicates that even if an audit has been carried out, there are still questions about the truthfulness or accuracy of the reported information that is included in the financial statements.</p>
<p>A qualified opinion is meant to serve as a <strong>warning to investors and other interested parties</strong>, indicating that there is a possibility of financial loss as a result of doing business with or investing in the firm. A qualified opinion will often contain wording such as "<strong>except for" or "subject to</strong>," which informs readers that some parts of the company's finances need to be treated with care and should not necessarily be relied on without more research.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Adverse Opinion</h3>
<p>One of the most undesirable types of opinions that a company may get is known as an <strong>adverse opinion</strong>. It is an assessment that all of a firm's financial records, which the company has submitted, are not in compliance with the <strong>Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).</strong> This opinion implies that a firm's <strong>financial statements may be false</strong>, which might result in undesirable results, such as investors losing trust in the organization and shareholders suing the corporation. Because a negative opinion may also be a sign that there is <strong>fraud</strong> going on inside the company, it is wise to take quick action in the event that this sort of opinion becomes publicly known.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Disclaimer of Opinion</h3>
<p>A statement issued by an auditor indicating that <strong>no opinion</strong> is being expressed about the company's financial accounts is referred to as a <strong>disclaimer of opinion</strong>. This disclaimer might be provided for several reasons. For instance, the auditor may not have been granted permission or might not have had the ability to finish all of the planned audit processes. If the company gives the auditor permission to finish the planned work or if the company fixes an underlying irregularity, then the auditor may be able to deliver a clean opinion. The disclaimer will continue to be in effect until the auditor provides a new opinion to replace the previous one.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Indicators of Going Concern Problems</h2>
<p>Even though it may seem like a single event or problem can spell the end for a business, there are actually many things that could lead to a company's demise.</p>
<p>The presence of any of the following warning signs is a strong indicator that a firm may be unable to continue operating as a going concern:</p>
<h3 class="h3">Insufficient Financial Resources</h3>
<p>In the event that a firm is unable to meet either its <strong>short-term</strong> or its <strong>long-term financial commitments</strong>, this sends a warning signal across the business. This is a common indicator that the company is facing significant financial challenges and is unable to continue meeting its payment responsibilities, which may result in the company becoming bankrupt. Such failure to pay obligations when they become due casts doubt on the company's capacity to continue as a going concern.</p>
<p>It is possible for businesses to not have sufficient cash or other resources on hand to be able to fulfill their commitments, and as a result, they may be forced to borrow money or sell assets in order to remain afloat.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Lack of Demand</h3>
<p>The ability to continue operating as a going concern depends on the firm's ability to <strong>attract and retain customers</strong>, so if they are no longer in demand, the company may require outside assistance. This very low level of demand is a huge warning sign that must not be disregarded. The drop in demand may be attributable to a number of factors, including <strong>changes in client requirements or preferences</strong>, or it may simply be the case that the <strong>product is no longer considered to be fashionable</strong>. When something like this happens, businesses have a responsibility to take preventative action in order to guarantee that they will continue to be profitable in the long run.</p>
<p>These actions might include <strong>increasing marketing efforts</strong> to acquire new consumers and offering new goods and services that fulfill the demands of existing customers.</p>
<h3 class="h3">The Legal or Regulatory Issue</h3>
<p>There may be doubts regarding a company's ability to continue as a going concern if it is experiencing <strong>legal or regulatory issues</strong>. This may be seen as a warning sign by <strong>prospective investors, lenders, and business partners</strong>, indicating that there are possible pitfalls to be aware of before engaging in commercial transactions with the firm. It is essential for companies to handle any legal or regulatory concerns in a timely and efficient manner in order to prevent the growth of existing difficulties, as well as to show their dedication to maintaining their company operations.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Competition</h3>
<p>In order for businesses to maintain their position in the market and remain profitable, they are required by the market to decrease their prices and cut their earnings. This ultimately results in the firm having less money for its own operations. As a result of the <strong>competition</strong>, a <strong>company's market share</strong>, as well as its <strong>profitability</strong>, will decrease over time.</p>
<p>This may result in difficulties with cash flow, rising levels of debt, and a diminishing supply of resources.</p>
<p>If these concerns are not handled immediately and efficiently, they may place a substantial strain on a company's capacity to pay its obligations as they mature. If the firm is unable to pay its financial responsibilities, it may be forced to file for bankruptcy or seek other alternatives to survival. Any business needs to strike a careful balance between staying competitive with rivals and making enough money. If this isn't done right, it could spell disaster for the future of the organization.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Loss of the Patent</h3>
<p>When an organization loses a license or a patent, this is often seen as a warning sign by shareholders and investors. The removal of such essential components raises significant doubt about the company's ability to continue operating as a going concern and gives rise to grave worries in this regard.</p>
<p>The loss of a patent or license may place a considerable strain on a company's capacity to <strong>produce income, grow market share, or maintain its competitiveness</strong> in comparison to other organizations in a <strong>similar industry</strong>. Without this defence against rivals, there is little to no guarantee that the company will be successful in the long run. As a consequence of this, investors have to pay great attention to the process of reviewing the company's financial statements and any other relevant papers in order to determine whether or not their investments would be successful.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Not Getting a Loan</h3>
<p>When a firm's <strong>loan application is denied</strong>, or <strong>current loan terms are not extended</strong>, it is a huge warning sign that lenders have lost confidence in the company. This may have devastating effects on a business since, without enough funding, it may be impossible to keep operating as a <strong>going concern</strong>.</p>
<p>The lender's lack of confidence could be caused by falling sales, high-interest debt, or other things that make the lender worried about the business's future. It is critical for firms to respond swiftly and, if possible, seek out other sources of financing in this circumstance. Additionally, businesses should conduct an audit of their operations and investigate the reasons their loan requests were denied in order to determine what went wrong and how they might improve moving ahead.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Supplier's Refusal to Provide Credit</h3>
<p>If a firm's suppliers <strong>refuse to grant credit</strong> to it, it may be a sign that they no longer find the company to be credible enough to engage in any future business dealings with them. This may be an indication of a possible "<strong>going concern</strong>" issue, which occurs when a company is unable to continue operations owing to problems with either its liquidity or its profitability.</p>
<p>Suppliers are generally the first to become aware of any financial troubles that the firm may be experiencing, and as a result, they will often act in their own self-interest by restricting the amount of credit they are willing to offer. This choice may be made not just due to financial concerns but also because they have lost confidence in the company's capacity to respect its obligations and make timely payments.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Employee Turnover</h3>
<p>When high-level managers suddenly leave their positions, it may be a warning that something is wrong inside the organization. The loss of such <strong>experienced personnel</strong> may have far-reaching and long-term effects on the <strong>stability and sustainability</strong> of the company. Therefore, it is crucial for any firm to be aware of when this kind of circumstance occurs and to act right away.</p>
<p>The absence of <strong>skilled employees and labour hardships</strong> are both warning signs that must not be ignored. If a company does not have enough qualified people, it may have problems with its basic operations and may also find it difficult to fulfill the needs of customers or the requirements of regulators.</p>
<p>In either instance, proper, decisive action is required to preserve organizational stability and earn the trust of consumers, investors, and other stakeholders.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Relying on Discounted Sales</h3>
<p>Increasing a company's cash flow and lowering its inventory levels may both be accomplished by <strong>discounting</strong> its goods and services. This can assist businesses in remaining <strong>solvent</strong>.</p>
<p>However, It is essential for companies to avoid becoming overly dependent on reduced price as a long-term solution, despite the fact that discounting may assist in keeping a company's operations running smoothly.</p>
<p>If a corporation relies excessively on discounts, this might eventually result in <strong>reduced profit margins</strong> as well as <strong>decreased customer loyalty</strong>, both of which could put the future of the company in danger if the practice is maintained for an exceptionally long period of time. A sustainable approach should incorporate various techniques that create consumer loyalty like as <strong>rewards programs</strong> or <strong>focused marketing efforts</strong>. This will allow the going concern status to be maintained without depending too much on reduced prices.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Advantage of Going Concern</h2>
<ol class="points">
<li>Companies often spend a lot of money on fixed assets in the first few years of operation. However, the benefits of these purchases are spread out over the life of an asset, which is usually more than a year. The concept takes into account the need to keep track of these costs over the useful lives of the assets.</li>
<li>It indicates to prospective investors how well the company is doing, lowers the risk and uncertainty of investing, and promotes further investment.</li>
<li>Businesses have an easier time obtaining loans from banks if they have a solid financial track record. This is because banks tend to favour dealing with firms that have established going concern status.</li>
<li>The assets and liabilities of the firm are documented at their cost in order to demonstrate to potential investors that the company is financially stable and that its primary focus is not on quickly liquidating its holdings but rather on continuous expansion over the course of the long run.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="h2">Disadvantage of Going Concern</h2>
<ol class="points">
<li>It discourages businesses from being experimental and creative. Because they need consistent financial backing and stability, companies have a tendency to become too cautious with their choices and investments. This may lead to a halt in terms of the company's development and performance.</li>
<li>Instead of using the Mark to Market method, the financial statements are created using the cost method. When a firm is being wound up or liquidated, the financial statements are often written on a Mark to Market basis, which may result in vastly different figures than those calculated on a cost basis.</li>
<li>In the event that the company ceases operations while the financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, the information shown will not be accurate and may mislead the stakeholders.</li>
<li>Relying on the going concern concept might provide management with incentives to keep the firm operational, despite the fact that it could be in the company's best interest to shut down operations. This might result in more financial losses and raise the likelihood of defaulting on debt obligations.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="h2">Example of Going Concern</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of the automobile industry in the United States, <strong>General Motors Corporation (GMC)</strong> has been consistently regarded as one of the most important companies in the sector. However, GMC was hit by a financial problem and <strong>declared bankruptcy</strong> in the early 2000s. Because of this significant risk to the company's ability to continue operating as a <strong>going concern</strong>, the federal government was forced to intervene and provide assistance in the form of a <strong>bailout package</strong>.</p>
<p>GMC was given access to emergency cash of several billion dollars as part of the bailout package, which assisted the company in maintaining its operations throughout its transition period. The corporation used the funds to reorganize its debt as well as its operations and to cut down on its personnel expenses. This made it easy for GMC to quickly get out of bankruptcy and stay competitive in the automotive world. Furthermore, it allowed GMC to concentrate on the development of new technologies that would contribute to its long-term success.</p>
<p>The United States Government held the majority of the company's shares at one point (after the 2008 bailouts). However, in <strong>2010</strong>, GM broke free from the shackles that the government had placed on it and was reborn as the company that it is today.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The term "<strong>going concern</strong>" refers to the fundamental accounting concept that states a company will keep running into the foreseeable future. It is a fundamental of accounting that is <strong>recognized all around the world</strong> and is one that is widely acknowledged.</p>
<p>It's one of the factors auditors look at when determining how stable a company's finances are in its audit report. It should come as no surprise that a going concern has several advantages, the most notable of which is the peace of mind it bestows on companies and the confidence it instils in investors.</p>
<p>The concept of a going concern has far-reaching consequences, and because of this, one should not treat it disrespectfully since it is one of the most important factors that might influence whether or not a company will be successful. It is critical for businesses to have a solid understanding of this concept and to give serious consideration to how the choices they make may have an effect on the long-term sustainability of their operations.</p>
