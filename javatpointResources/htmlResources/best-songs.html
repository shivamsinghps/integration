<h1 class="h1">Best Songs</h1>
<p>We all commit time to activities such as painting, dancing, designing, and listening to music in our lives. Every interest leads to some level of happiness and pleasure. Music or song is one such item that, regardless of age, is pursued by everyone. Music is a pleasing sound that generates a balance of harmony and melody. For us, music is an art form, and for many, it is a way of life. Music can exist without words, such as a stage performance based on the tune of a musical instrument. However, most of us are familiar with music as a song sung by celebrities in the world of singing. Songs with no music are only lyrics. As a result, lyrics require the assistance of music to become a song. Any musical instrument or a person singing it out loud in an appropriate rhythm and tone can generate music to accompany the lyrics.</p>
<p>The music that various cultures perform today is ancient in origin. Earlier, a man had no concept of music, yet they heard the sound of a waterfall, birds chirping, trees falling, air whispering, and other natural sounds. All of this gave it a rhythmical aura, and primitive men began to regard it as music or a tune without any lyrics. However, it's difficult to say whether music or song lyrics arose first because there are shlokas in Buddhism and Ohm in Hinduism that sound melodic without music. To be more accurate, music is simply a sound that can be both pleasant and annoying in today's society. Still, it becomes a kind of art when it is generated in various pitches and brings out the melody and harmony involved. On the other side, the song is a combination of lyrics, music, and instruments. A song is made up of a few instruments, devices, and voices.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Let's look at what importance music and songs hold!</h3>
<ol class="points">
<li>It brings people from various cultural backgrounds together. It fosters social cohesion, and it is frequently claimed that when words fail, music or song connects and speaks for everyone, with human interaction at its core.</li>
<li>Music helps our health and well-being by refreshing our minds. According to a Harvard University study, those who listen to music or songs had a lower risk of disease. Listening to music lowers blood pressure and pulse rate while stimulating and relaxing the brain from all types of stress and pain.</li>
<li>Music improves the quality of learning. Music is an extremely effective tool for boosting memory. This is due to our mind's love for music. Our brain preserves everything it enjoys. This is due to the fact that whenever we love something, memories are stored in our minds indefinitely. As a result, we must admire something in order to feel it. A wonderful approach to do this is through music. Teachers teach poems to toddlers as soon as they start school or pre-school. They recite poems for the kids. Children are enthralled by it and store it in their minds. The poems are made more enjoyable by the music. Perhaps this is why we all remember the poems we were taught as children so well, and they will continue to do so in the long term. Students have been taught multiplication tables using music. Children enjoy singing the multiplication table in the style of a poem, and they retain it.</li>
<li>Music or songs can boost your self-esteem and resilience. Learning a musical instrument teaches discipline and endurance because it requires mastering technique and literacy. When we sing together, it improves our teamwork and leadership skills, and it gives us a sense of accomplishment when we master tough lyrics and melodies.</li>
<li>Listening to music is pleasurable. It gives people of all social and cultural backgrounds a creative medium through which they can express themselves. Musicians and vocalists have used sound to represent themselves, whether it's to convey a political statement, a particular mood, or even pure delight. Furthermore, singing is pure enjoyment and the ideal time to spend as a recreational activity. Music brings happiness to people's lives, whether it's a live performance in front of an audience, learning a new piece, or competing in a singing competition with friends.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's look at why songs and music are so important in Bollywood. We must admit that music and Bollywood are inextricably linked, as there isn't a single Hindi film in which a Hindi song isn't composed in response to some situation, emotion, or occasion. However, the style in Bollywood music has shifted over time, from sorrowful songs to ballads with Urdu lyrics, as well as from pure Hindi songs to Punjabi remixes, with the use of the English language becoming the current fashion.</p>
<p>Another reason songs are a significant feature of Bollywood films is that they are utilized to promote the films themselves. Songs are frequently published first in order to pique public interest in seeing the flicks in theaters. As a result, playback singers in movies are just as significant and well-known as the actors who star in them today. Crazy fans will occasionally go to the movies solely to hear their favorite singer's song. The most crucial aspect is how a song is introduced in a Bollywood film. It happens because the songs are used to reflect on the events of the film. It is placed into the plot in such a way that the characters are inspired to begin singing and mesmerizing. Let's discover some of the <strong><em>best songs</em></strong> that will take us on an emotional roller-coaster.</p>
<h2 class="h2">1. Tum Hi Ho (Movie: Aashiqui 2)</h2>
<p>This song was included in the 2013 film <em>'Aashiqui 2'</em> and is a romance-type song sung by fans' favorite Arijit Singh. Mithoon penned the lyrics for this song. The actor Aditya Roy Kapoor and actress Shraddha Kapoor perform this song.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-songs1.png" alt="Best Songs" />
<p>This song grew in popularity to the point where it was ranked first in MTV India's Top 20 and also in Planet Bollywood's Top 10. In 2014, this song was also named Song of the Year at the Zee Cine Awards. In terms of the song's success, it received around 5 million views on YouTube first 10 days of its release, boosting the film's promotion immensely. It was so favorably accepted by the public that other amateur singers and DJs developed other remix versions of the song. This song created such a lot of buzz that the film became an instant blockbuster upon its release, grossing 132 crores in just a few weeks. As of March 2021, this song has received 281 million views on YouTube, T-series. Palak Muchhal recently launched a duet version of this song called 'Meri Aashiqui.'</p>
<h2 class="h2">2. All is well (Movie: 3 Idiots)</h2>
<p>In 2009, a film called <em>"3 Idiots"</em> was set to be produced, and its promotional song was released on November 27 of that year, shortly before the film's release. Times of India later named it one of the top ten Bollywood songs of 2009.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-songs2.png" alt="Best Songs" />
<p>The inspiration for all of the albums in this film came from college days. Each track represents the mentality of a teenager, and this song depicts the solace one gives to oneself during moments of stress and anxiety in college. With so much pressure from university, college, family, and self, student life can be unpleasant at times. This song tells the pupil that everything will be OK and that all they have to do is mislead their minds into letting go of the complications they have constructed. It just demonstrates that when life gets out of hand, we should yell, "All izz Well," and the problem will be rectified immediately. The primary gang of three fools in this film sings this song. Off-camera, this song is performed by Sonu Nigam, Shaan, and Swanand Kirkire. Shantanu Moira composed the music for this song, with Swanand Kirkire writing the lyrics. Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Sharman Joshi, R. Madhavan, and Boman Irani star in the video for this song, which was directed by Rajkumar Hirani. It's a wonderful upbeat tune for all of the students who are having trouble and looking out to relax oneself.</p>
<h2 class="h2">3. Jai Ho (Movie: Slumdog Millionaire)</h2>
<p>Another excellent song is Jai Ho, which appears in Danny Boyle's 2008 film <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em>. This song's music is composed by A.R. Rahman, who was approached by the film's director to compose it after being impressed by his work. Tanvi Shah performed the English-Spanish section of the song alongside A.R. Rahman.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-songs3.png" alt="Best Songs" />
<p>This song is used to complement a choreographed dance sequence in the film's closing scene. However, it is reported that the song Jai Ho was originally written for a film named "Yuvraaj", which was rejected by its director Subhash Ghai because the sound did not fit the film's character. When translated into English, the song's title, Jai Ho, corresponds to the topic of victory, as it declares, "Let Victory Prevail." On November 25, 2008, this song was released. Gulzar and Tanvi Shah collaborated on the lyrics for this song. According to the producer of this song, A.R. Rahman, the soundtrack or music for this song took him two and a half months to complete. This music, according to Rahman, does not symbolize or refer to Indian culture; rather, it could suit any place because the story itself is inspiring, as the show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" is shown in every country. Tanvi Shah, Sukhwinder Singh, Vijay Prakash, and Mahalakshmi Iyer were the main vocalists here. Jai Ho became the first Hindi song to win an Oscar as a result of its international success.</p>
<h2 class="h2">4. Channa Mereya (Movie: Ae Dil Hai Mushkil)</h2>
<p>Channa Mereya is another musical masterpiece by Pritam sung in the magical voice of none other than Arijit Singh. Channa Mereya is a heartache song from the 2016 film <em>Ae Dil Hai Mushkil</em>, which has over 300 million views on Sony Music India's Official youtube channel. It received immediate praise from reviewers and was an instant hit among the audience. The song, composed by Pritam and written by Amitabh Bhattacharya, is solely about Ranbir and Anushka's love story and is dedicated to unrequited love.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-songs4.png" alt="Best Songs" />
<p>The song depicts Ayan (played by Ranbir Kapoor) performing at Alizeh's (played by Anushka Sharma) wedding and has glimpses of some of their wonderful times. In the film, Ranbir Kapoor plays a love-struck man who sings his heart out at Anushka Sharma's wedding. Although Anushka initially believes his 'buddy' is simply enjoying her big day, she soon realizes from his behavior that he is communicating his heartbreak. While the joyous reminiscence moments hint at Ayan's heartbreak, it isn't fully realized until the song's conclusion. Arijit Singh's strong voice brings out the perfect balance of the happy wedding anthem and the sad version. The Sufi-influenced lyrics bring out the sentiments of a shattered spirit, then attempt to cure the injured soul with long lyrical poetry. "Channa Mereya" is one of JioSaavn's most popular songs of all time. The song has received as many as 10 awards to date under different categories.</p>
<h2 class="h2">5. Aye Mere Watan Ke Logon</h2>
<p>We enjoy a variety of musical genres, including romantic, humorous, sadistic, and patriotic songs. We all adore our motherland and have a strong sense of obligation to it. As a result, listening to a patriotic song increases our sense of belonging and patriotism. It serves as a reminder of how fortunate we are to be born in such a wonderful country. Similarly, this patriotic song, <em>'Aye Mere Watan Ke Logon,'</em> was penned in the context of the Sino-Indian war of 1962. Kavi Pradeep wrote the Hindi lyrics for this song, and C. Ramachandra arranged the music, with Lata Mangeshkar singing it beautifully.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-songs5.png" alt="Best Songs" />
<p>We've all heard about and read about the 1962 conflict between India and China, which was sparked by a disagreement over the Himalayan boundary. The Indian side suffered enormous losses in this fight, and the Chinese side triumphed, consolidating their position in Aksai Chin. This was a tremendous defeat for then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's aspirations since his idealistic foreign policy opposing Chinese encroachment failed miserably. Looking at the heavy casualties against this backdrop, lyricist Kavi Pradeep was emotionally moved and expressed his sentiments in words to memorialize the Indian soldiers who died during the battle. In truth, he created the lyrics while walking on Mahim Beach in Mumbai in late 1962. Inspired, he grabbed a pen from a nearby walker and scribbled the first few words or the initial stanza on a piece of foil cut from his pack of cigarettes. The vocalist Lata Mangeshkar gave the first live rendition of this song on India's Republic Day, January 26, 1963, in Delhi. It was held at New Delhi's National Stadium. Because Republic Day was only two months after the war ended, the then-President and Prime Minister also attended the concert. Nehru was brought to tears by the song's presentation. In addition, the event raised 2 lakh for the Army Welfare Fund. Since then, this song has been performed at various public gatherings and festivals, and it is regarded best and most popular nationalistic song, alongside the National Anthem and others.</p>
<h2 class="h2">6. Jeena Yahan Marna Yahan (Movie: Mera Naam Joker)</h2>
<p>When we talk about the best songs, we must not overlook the old classical songs of our parents' generation, which have not only a super melodic low voice tune but also some of the best words in comparison to modern times. All of the emotions and sensations were brilliantly expressed on paper by the lyricists of the day, which is sadly lacking today.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-songs6.png" alt="Best Songs" />
<p>This song, 'Jeena Yahan Marna Yahan,' is from the 1970 Hindi romantic movie <em>'Mera Naam Joker.'</em> This song is performed by Mukesh, and the lyrics were penned by Shailendra. On December 31, 1970, it was released. The song lasts for four and a half minutes. This song nicely depicts how life will be challenging, but we must persevere. We will all endure extreme difficulties in life, but it is up to us to support each other and keep moving forward. This film is based on the life of a circus performer who makes the audience laugh at his expense. The film begins with this song, in which Raj Kapoor appears as a clown or circus performer who invites three women to attend his show and who have a significant impact on his life. The actor then takes the audience through a flashback of how he fell in love with them at various periods of his life, but because he was a joker, undeserving of these women, his love stories always ended in disaster.</p>
<h2 class="h2">7. Chak De! India (Movie: Chak De! India)</h2>
<p>The title track for the Indian sports drama <em>Chak De! India</em> was released in 2007, starring Shah Rukh Khan in the lead. It was created by the pair of Salim-Sulaiman and lyrics written by Jaideep Sahni and recorded by Sukhwinder Singh, Salim Merchant, and Marianne D'Cruz. On August 1, 2007, the Chak De! India music album was premiered. It has become a popular sports anthem since the film's launch. Although the song was written for hockey, in particular, it has since become a sort of anthem for any sporting event featuring Indian teams or even individual sportsmen.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-songs7.png" alt="Best Songs" />
<p>The album begins with 'dhol' beats inviting you to the playing field with 'Chak De India.' In the song, Sukhvinder Singh appears passionate as always, highlighting India's pride and determination to keep its head up in the face of adversity. The song is a go-to motivational anthem in every situation, and along with the movie, it was inspiring not only for women in sports but for everybody who wants to make a difference in their lives. According to Salim Merchant, it "nearly became the country's sports anthem, especially when Indian National Cricket Team won the 2011 Cricket World Cup; it was no more our track but the nation's anthem." The song has received over 55 million views and boasts over 400k likes on YRF's official Youtube account.</p>
<h2 class="h2">8. Teri Deewani (Album: Teri Deewani)</h2>
<p>Kailash Kher is recognized for his many melodious and amazing songs, one of which being <em>'Teri Deewani</em>,' in which his voice stirs the emotions of the audience. Kailash Kher and others, including Naresh and Paresh Kamath, sing it in Hindi. Kailash Kher provides the lead vocals for this track. It's basically an album song from Kailash Kher's Kailasa.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-songs8.png" alt="Best Songs" />
<p>This song was published in 2006 and lasts for around 5 minutes and 24 seconds. Kailasa is an album that is a hybrid of Sufism and fusion music from India. The band's name is derived from Kailash Kher's own name. This band uses traditional musical instruments and classic lyrics in addition to modern instruments like guitar, drums, and keyboards to create a blend of folk and Sufi colors. The album has a total of nine tracks. The first song is 'Teri Deewani,' which is a love song that incorporates the themes of love and dedication. The song's words and vocals are just as good as the video or story it tells. This song contains five separate narratives, all of which revolve around the basic theme of boundless love and desire.</p>
<p>The video begins with a girl in a white salwar standing at the fort, where she frequently met with her lover, who left her because he could be seen sitting on a bus. When Kailash Kher sang the song's words ('Haste haste aashiq suli chad jayein'), the girl commits suicide by jumping from the fort. Another narrative in the film illustrates total love in a five-minute song, which contrasts with the first story about incomplete love. It depicts a pair who always meets up and smiles to the end.</p>
<p>The third story in the video is about acceptance, in which a girl is seen in a truck leaving her boyfriend behind, who is running after her, but he eventually stops and gives up, and both can be seen with a satisfied expression at the end, as both seem to have harmony detected by the characters' smiles. The fourth narrative is about love at first sight, in which a man falls in love with a girl for whom he was hired to murder her. However, he immediately abandons his plan when he sees the girl's face and falls in love, but the girl flees when she sees the knife in his hand. They were strangers, not lovers, but it only took a split second for them to fall in love. The song's fifth and final plot describes a girl who has gone insane in love and dances under the lights of firecrackers after sunset. It could also be interpreted as self-love, in which the girl dances alone with no one else present. The girl dances and displays the highest kind of love where there is no expectation from the other side, which is something that everyone should strive for.</p>
<h2 class="h2">9. Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna (Movie: Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge)</h2>
<p><em>Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna</em> is a classic Hindi song from the 1995 Hindi romantic film <em>Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</em>. The vocals for the song were given by legendary singers Udit Narayan and Lata Mangeshkar. It is widely regarded as one of India's most popular songs played during different wedding celebratory events. Shahrukh Khan and Kajol play the crucial components in the song. The song was composed by music composer duo Jatin - Lalit and directed by Aditya Chopra, while Anand Bakshi is credited for the song's lyrics. The song made its singer Udit Narayan receive the Best Playback Male Singer Award at the 41<sup>st</sup> Filmfare Awards.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-songs9.png" alt="Best Songs" />
<p>The song was featured in a film segment depicting one of the wedding rituals with the actors of the movie. Although the song was initially supposed to be in another film, it eventually became a part of <em>Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</em>. Not just that, but the song's lyrics were also meant to be different. However, Aditya Chopra and Uday Chopra were so taken with the song that they included it in DDLJ, making it the most popular song and a must-have at all wedding ceremonies! Even after more than 2 decades, the song is as evergreen and as much loved by Bollywood music lovers as is the movie itself. The song's popularity can also be gauged from the fact that it had gotten more than 185 million views on YRF's official youtube page as of May 2022.</p>
<h2 class="h2">10. Sadda Haq (Movie: Rockstar)</h2>
<p>"Sadda Haq," regarded as the present generation's rock anthem, is a song from the 2011 film <em>Rockstar</em>, directed by Imtiaz Ali and starring Ranbir Kapoor and Nargis Fakhri. The song's powerful chords, crafted by A. R. Rahman, transport listeners to a universe where music is simply rocking. Mohit Chauhan sings lead vocals, with Clinton Cerejo and Arpit Gupta contributing additional vocals. Orianthi performs as a guitarist in the song.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/best/images/best-songs10.png" alt="Best Songs" />
<p>According to accounts in the media, the lyrics of 'Sadda Haq' were drawn by a peasant revolt that occurred in and around the country's capital a few years back. Mohit Chauhan thrives as a rebel voice thanks to the song's bold word choice. Ranbir Kapoor performs before a live crowd in the song video. The band performed in front of a crowded gathering at the Norbulingka monastery in McLeod Ganj, Dharamsala, Antonio De Souza High School in Mumbai, and Central Park in Connaught Place, Delhi. Sadda Haq is the movie's major track, and it was written to be a significant smash, both lyrically and in other dimensions. Sadda Haq is a catchphrase with a lot of mainstream appeals. It's a fantastic song in terms of passion and emotion. The synth and overdriven distorted chords give it a very rough, gritty rock show vibe. It is that one song that you can't detest or ignore, whether you like it or not.</p>
