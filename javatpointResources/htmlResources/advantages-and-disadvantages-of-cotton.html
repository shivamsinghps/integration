<h1 class="h1">Advantages and Disadvantages of Cotton</h1>
<p>Cotton is a soft, downy substance that resembles fine wool. It is grown almost everywhere in the world. However, it is most prevalent in the U.S.A., India, Egypt, and Brazil. In India, it is mostly planted throughout areas like the Deccan, Punjab, U.P., Tripura, and Assam. Presently, it is the Indian cotton plant. It is considered to be the 2nd largest product produced in the world.</p>
<p>Cotton is among the major fibers and cash crops in India and plays a major role in the manufacturing and agricultural economies of the nation. It is the main raw material (cotton fiber) for the cotton textile industry. The cotton industry in India is the primary source of income for six million farmers. 40-50 million people work in the cotton trade and processing.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/blog/images/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-cotton.png" alt="Advantages and Disadvantages of Cotton" />
<p>In India, there are ten cotton-growing states, which are separated into three areas, which are viz., north zone, central zone, and south zone. The north zone is comprised of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. The central zone comprises Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. The South zone includes Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. In addition to these states, cotton cultivation is growing in the Eastern State of Orissa. The cultivation of Cotton is also taking place in smaller areas of non-traditional states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Tripura.</p>
<p>The source of Cotton is a plant of the same name. Some varieties of Cotton grow tall, while others remain very small. They require long, warm, dry weather and a good amount of rain in order to grow properly.</p>
<p>The pods appear on the plants in the autumn. They pop up when they're ripe and emerge numerous black seeds that are covered in Cotton that is as with white in appearance. It is then taken apart, removed from seeds, and stuffed into bales before being sent to the places where it is sought-after. The cotton fiber is separated out of seeds in factories with the aid of machines through the process known as ginning.</p>
<p>Cotton is used to make fabric, quilts, mattresses, and other bedding, as well as utilized in furniture. The fabric is made not out of Cotton but from the thread or yarn made from it. Thread is also used for sewing.</p>
<p>The spinning process can be carried out either in a mill or an instrument made from wood, also known as the spinning wheel or charka. Threads are woven into cloth using mills or on a handloom.</p>
<p>In India, the industry of handlooms has evolved, and now cloth is made by weavers from yarn spun using the aid of charka by the people in the villages. There are numerous textile mills that produce Cotton in India where spin-ring and weaving of cloth are done with modern machinery. Today, Indian Cotton is exported each year to Europe as well as other nations in large amounts.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Origin and Distribution of Cotton</h2>
<p>India is considered to be the place where arboretums thrive. G.herbaceum could have come into the western part of India via Arabia, Persia, and Baluchistan, as well as race Acerifolium. The barbadense appears to have developed within South America as a wild species and then evolved into a cultivated species.</p>
<p>The barbodense perennial has led to the development of Tanguis cotton. They are ratooned and account for 90% of the Peruvian crop. Cytological studies have shown that all 4 species belong to the monophyletic category (evolved from an interspecific hybrid). G.hirsutum species must be extinct from the middle of diversity close to the border between Mexico and Guatemala.</p>
<p>The most significant plant fiber that is grown in around 60 countries across the globe is Cotton. Countries such as Russia, the USA, China, India, Brazil, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Mexico, and Sudan account for around 85 percent of the total production of Cotton.</p>
<p>Cotton, the most popular of fibers, is an industrial resource that is of global significance. It is among the major commercial crops, playing an important role in social and economic global affairs. It is believed that the Arabic word quantum, also known as kutun, was the basis for the English term cotton. It is also the word kateon in Dutch, colon in French, Cottone in Italian, and algodon in Spanish that Cotton is derived.</p>
<p>Despite the recent downturns, the cotton industry is still the foundation of the Indian rural economies, especially in dryland regions. In addition to being a money spinner, it is also an employment source since its cultivation can provide 200 man-days ha-1 of work. Around 60 million people earn their income through the cultivation process of Cotton or its processing and trade.</p>
<p>The current crisis in Cotton revolves around key issues like the increasing cost of production, increased usage of pesticides that are not effective in the control of pests, inability to boost production during the monsoon season because of inadequate water management, the decline in the genetic purity of the numerous cotton cultivars, insufficient price support and a lack of infrastructure that can ensure the highest quality products at the farmer's level.</p>
<p>In light of the current market conditions, cotton farmers must reconsider their strategies in relation to the set of practices they employ in cultivating Cotton. Inputs that are a waste and accompanied by wishful thoughts of a bigger harvest need to be discouraged.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Cotton Textile Industry</h2>
<p>Cotton is among the most organized sector in the United States in terms of the workforce (nearly 1 million employees) and the number of units.</p>
<p>The cotton textile industry is an indigenous manufacturing process that was initiated and developed by predominately Indian capital and entrepreneurial spirit. Presently, India is in third place when it comes to producing cotton fabric. It is among the biggest industries when it comes to the number of jobs and production.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/blog/images/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-cotton2.png" alt="Advantages and Disadvantages of Cotton" />
<p>The textile industry of Cotton is the most ancient and largest industry in India. Indirectly or directly, over 15 million people rely on this sector for their livelihood.</p>
<p>Kawasji Dhaber established the first successful cotton textile mill using modern designs in Mumbai in 1854. In the following years, two factories, namely, Shahpur mill and Calico mill - were built in Ahmedabad. In 1879-1880, there were more than 58 mills operating in the nation. The wars in the world helped boost this industry, and there were more mills which grew up to 423 by 1947. The industry faced a huge setback because of the partition of the nation. India had 409 mills and 27 percent of the cotton-producing area following the partition.</p>
<p>After Independence, the industry grew rapidly as the total number of mills increased to 1782 by the year 1998. From this, there were 192 mills in the government sector, 151 were in the cooperative sector, and 1439 mills were in the private sector. In addition, handlooms and power looms have increased dramatically during this time.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth is made in three different sectors: (i) mills, (ii) power looms, and (iii) handlooms. The cotton industry accounts for over 73 % of the total fiber consumed in spinning mills and over 58 percent of all yarn consumption within the textile industry.</p>
<p>The power loom industry that is decentralized plays an important role in meeting the cotton needs of the nation. The contribution of this sector to the total production of cloth for the entire country stands at 59.2 percent. The power loom industry produces many different clothes. These can be either grey or intricately designed. The country's handloom sector employs over 65 million people and accounts for nearly 19% of total cloth production.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Cotton Production and Area</h2>
<p>Globally, cotton cultivation covers 35 Mha with a yield of around 23 Mt and a productivity of approximately 650 kg per hectare. India's cotton area is between 7.5 to 9.0 Mha with a production of 10-14 M bales (170 kg).</p>
<p>According to the most recent statistics (FAOSTAT 2009), the top ten Cotton producing nations (M bales) are China (32.0), India (23.5), the United States (12.4), Pakistan (10.8) and Brazil (5.5), Uzbekistan (4.4), Australia (1.8), Turkey (1.7), Turkmenistan (1.1) and Syria (1.0).</p>
<p>India has the biggest area under Cotton (10.13 million ha), which is 30% of the global cotton area. It also ranks second in terms of production (22.228 bales) to China (15% of global cotton production). India's cotton area is approximately 9.0 Mha.</p>
<p>However, productivity increased fourfold during that same time period from 104 kg per head in 1956-67 up to 400 kg per head during 2009-10. From a mere 4.2 million bales in 1947-1948, production grew to 22.3 million bales by 2009-10. The cotton yield in India has increased by almost 50 percent over the past five years.</p>
<p>A significant milestone in Indian cotton history is the development of cotton hybrids in the 1970s. These cotton hybrids now cover around 50% of India's total cotton area. In 2015, the country's cotton demand was 40 million bales. It is possible to increase productivity above 600 kg ha-1 and to produce additional 12 million bales by using new technology.</p>
<p>According to the latest statistics, Maharashtra (3.50 million ha) is home to the largest area of Cotton in India, followed by Gujarat (2.45 million ha). These two states make up 52 percent of India's total area. The highest cotton production in India is found in Gujarat (7.01 million t), followed by Maharashtra (4.75 million t). These two slates make up about 40% of total cotton production in India. Punjab has the highest productivity (667 kg ha-1), followed by Haryana (646kg ha-1) and Gujarat (511 kg ha-1).</p>
<h2 class="h2">Climate, Soils, and Tillage of Cotton</h2>
<h3 class="h3">1. Climate:</h3>
<p>Cotton is a warm-weather crop. The cultivated varieties are not restricted to the tropics. In regions with less than 180 days of frost-free periods, adopted cultivars can be successful. Although Cotton is a short-lived plant, there are day-neutral cultivars. It can be grown in tropical regions around the globe, including as far north as China (43degN) and the USSR (43degN). Cotton is grown in India from 9 to 31 degrees.</p>
<p>The relationship between heat units and cotton yield is linear. The temperature seems to be the most important climatic parameter that affects cotton production. The minimum required growing day is 2,000 to 2,640 days above the base temperature of 10degC. Asiatic Cotton requires a temperature range of 21 to 27 degrees Celsius during the vegetative phase. Below 15 degrees C, it makes little growth.</p>
<p>The ideal temperature for germination ranges from 32 to 34 degrees Celsius. Research in India has shown that Cotton can be grown at temperatures between 43 and 46 degrees Celsius under the right soil moisture conditions. However, for hirsutism, it is 42 degrees C, and for barbadense, 37.5 degrees C. The ideal night temperature ranges from 15 to 20 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Although Cotton can be grown anywhere from sea level up to elevations of 1200-1500 m, its productivity is limited by the low temperatures at higher elevations. It can be grown in areas that receive 500 to 2,000mm of rainfall as a rainfed crop. A well-distributed rainfall of 900 to 1000 mm during the vegetative phase will help in better growth and yield. Cloudy weather leads to boll shedding. A minimum of 4 hours in bright sunlight is required. An intensity of light between 400 and 500 Cal cm-2 per day is thought to be ideal for cotton crops.</p>
<h3 class="h3">3. Soils:</h3>
<p>The most important soils in which Cotton is grown include alluvial soils, black cotton soils, red sandy loams, and laterites. The cotton plant is a rain-fed crop in black or medium black soils and an irrigated crop in alluvial and light soils. It doesn't stand waterlogging. The cotton crop is considered moderately acid-tolerant, and the essential pH range can be from 5.5 up to 6.0, and the maximum is 8.5.</p>
<p>The crop is deemed saline-tolerant, and the salinity threshold (initial decline in yield) is around 7.7 dS/m-1. The most important criterion to determine the suitability of soils in the optimal pH range is a minimum depth of at least 0.6 millimeters and a deficiency of excessive waterlogging.</p>
<p>The degradation of the soil's quality as a natural resource base can be seen in the traditional cotton belts. The high usage of external inputs to the crop has weakened the soil-water system, depleted the soil organic carbon, increased the productivity of the soil, and caused secondary salinization and waterlogging in some canal-irrigated tracts.</p>
<h3 class="h3">3. Tillage:</h3>
<p>These black soils from the south and central regions of India are prepared to sow Cotton that is rainfed by harrowing the field 3 to 4 times with blade harrows. The land is provided with deep plowing only once every 4 to 5 years to control perennial weeds. The soils that are lateritic and red in south India are typically plowed 3 times in the Kharif harvest that is rain-fed or plowed 2-3 times for the rabi crops. In the case of an irrigation-based crop, fields are plowed a few times after the irrigation is completed, and the soil is well prepared to sow the winter crop that is irrigated.</p>
<p>For the cotton crop that is irrigated following the wheat crop in north India, Land preparation is generally rushed since the interval between the harvesting of grain crops in March-April, and the sowing of Cotton irrigated in April and May is very brief. The soil is then given a massive irrigation and plowed a couple of times. After that, light irrigation is given after 1-2 ploughings. The soil is then sanded using a wooden plank prior to planting.</p>
<p>There are many advantages to Cotton over other fabrics. It's used in everything from bedding sheets, biofuels, currency, and cattle feed. The use of Cotton has been in place for more than 6000 years, and there are many compelling reasons to use it. What are the pros and cons of Cotton, and why is it suitable for clothing?</p>
<p>The advantages of this flexible material are numerous, and it is unlikely that we will abandon it in the near future. Cotton clothing has the benefit of being comfortable, soft, durable as well as breathable. It is a natural fiber that is produced in sufficient quantities to provide clothing to millions of people around the world while still remaining inexpensive and affordable. However, it has some major disadvantages you need to take note of. But first, let's look at its advantages-</p>
<h2 class="h2">The advantages of Cotton</h2>
<p>There are numerous benefits of Cotton, which include:</p>
<h3 class="h3">1. Cotton is the perfect color for all seasons</h3>
<p>Cotton is truly an all-weather fabric. Its fiber structure keeps you cool during the summer while offering a layer of insulation in winter.</p>
<h3 class="h3">2. Doesn't release Microplastics</h3>
<p>Contrary to synthetic fibers like acrylic, nylon, or polyester, Cotton doesn't release microplastics when washed. This is because it's a natural fiber, not one that is made of petroleum chemicals.</p>
<h3 class="h3">3. Affordable and Breathable</h3>
<p>There's a reason why Cotton has been used for many thousands of years. It's soft, comfy, and breathable, which makes it ideal for everything from jackets to underwear.</p>
<h3 class="h3">4. Versatile</h3>
<p>It is a remarkably versatile fabric that can be utilized in everything from soft silk clothes to more robust, stylish shirts. Cotton is woven in different thicknesses in order to modify its durability, warmth, and feel. There is a myriad of varieties of Cotton. Here are some that you've known about: denim, corduroy, suede, poplin, and jersey.</p>
<h3 class="h3">5. There's no waste</h3>
<p>One advantage of cultivating Cotton is that none of the plant's resources are wasted. Its seeds could be utilized to feed animals or to make cottonseed oil, and the stalks are then reintroduced into the soil after harvest. The entire plant of Cotton can be utilized to make various products.</p>
<h3 class="h3">6. Cotton is a natural fabric</h3>
<p>The natural fiber of Cotton is produced from cotton plants. The plants are planted in spring and harvested in autumn. It takes between five to six months from the time of planting till harvesting.</p>
<h3 class="h3">7. Cotton is incredibly strong</h3>
<p>One thing that distinguishes Cotton is its durability. In reality, when Cotton is wet, it's actually stronger and more durable, which is the opposite of the majority of cellulose fibers like rayon (wood pulp). This means you are able to allow your washer to take over the task without having to worry about your clothes becoming sloppy. It also allows your clothes to last longer, which is an important aspect of a sustainable wardrobe.</p>
<h3 class="h3">8. Cotton is non-allergic</h3>
<p>Cotton fabric has been suggested for people who have sensitive skin. It doesn't cause skin irritations; that's why it is used in gauze and bandages. If you can, avoid any unnecessary chemicals, and use organic Cotton.</p>
<h3 class="h3">9. Cotton is compostable</h3>
<p>Being a natural substance, it is recyclable and biodegradable. Untreated Cotton typically is broken down in less than six months. However, blended Cotton or treated Cotton may take longer.</p>
<h3 class="h3">10. Cotton farming is becoming more efficient</h3>
<p>Modern farming practices, specifically within the U.S., have improved the sustainability of Cotton through improvement in efficiency. The numbers vary based on the source; however, one study suggests that between the years 1980 to the year 2015, in America:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The total cotton production was up by 35%, while the planted acres fell by -2%.</li>
<li>Irrigation water usage decreased by -81% for each pound of lint produced</li>
<li>Energy consumption decreased by 38 percent per pound produced</li>
<li>Greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 30% per pound of lint.</li>
<li>Improved conservation of soil (tons of loss in soil per acre) decreased by -44%.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2">Disadvantages of Cotton</h2>
<p>There are numerous negatives associated with Cotton, specifically for those worried about sustainability. Here are nine disadvantages of wearing cotton clothes:</p>
<h3 class="h3">1. Cotton clothes fade over time</h3>
<p>You might have noticed that brightly colored cotton clothes appear to fade with time. This is due to the fact that Cotton doesn't retain dye very well. One example of a fabric that holds its color is Tencel.</p>
<h3 class="h3">2. Cotton can bleed when washed</h3>
<p>We've all been there while we turned a white top pink by adding something red into the washing. The negative feature of Cotton is the possibility that it could be prone to bleeding when washing because it is not able to retain dye well. To prevent this from happening, wash the colors separately or employ a color catcher and wash on a gentler cycle.</p>
<h3 class="h3">3. Cotton wrinkles</h3>
<p>There is no one who loves the look of clothes that are wrinkled, especially when you're lazy and don't like ironing. However, Cotton is prone to the problem of getting wrinkled easily and will take longer to iron out wrinkles as compared to bamboo, modal, or Tencel.</p>
<h3 class="h3">4. Cotton shrinks in hot water</h3>
<p>To have a sustainable wardrobe, don't wash your clothes at high temperatures because high-temperature washes can shrink your clothes. Cotton shrinks up to 3 percent, so stay clear of washing your clothes at high temperatures to preserve the shape of your new clothes. Follow the instructions for care on the label in case of doubt.</p>
<h3 class="h3">5. Cotton is not sustainable</h3>
<p>We started it; Cotton isn't sustainable. It is a natural substance, but it's not sustainable. According to the Made-By Environmental Benchmark for Fibres, Cotton is classified as an E-grade fabric, which is the lowest rating in this sustainability rating. On the contrary, the organic cotton classification is B-grade and is the second highest ranked.</p>
<h3 class="h3">6. Conventional Cotton can still contain pesticides</h3>
<p>The conventional cotton plant is grown with many chemicals in fertilizers and pesticides. In reality, Cotton is among the crops that are most dependent on chemicals around the world today, with only 2.4 percent of the land used for agriculture. However, it uses 5.7 percent of the world's pesticides and 16.1 percent of insecticides. The chemicals in the soil pollute local ecosystems and poison the people who cultivate it. A lot of them can be found in your clothes after being produced.</p>
<h3 class="h3">7. Cotton is a thirsty crop</h3>
<p>Is cotton a thirsty crop? It's a very popular question, but what does this really mean?</p>
<p>One of the downsides to Cotton is that it needs between 10,000 to 20,000 liters of water to produce one Kg of Cotton. That's the amount needed to create your most loved jeans and T-shirts. The majority of Cotton is grown in areas susceptible to drought, putting huge pressure on the water supply among populations that are already at risk.</p>
<h3 class="h3">8. Cotton can be grown unethically</h3>
<p>There are many disadvantages to Cotton for those who cultivate it, even though it can provide an income. In India, nearly half a million kids are employed by the cotton industry. They will never have a proper childhood or regular education. In the same way, Cotton has been linked to forced labor camps in China. Therefore, it is important to purchase ethically-made Cotton by searching for labels like Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) or the Fair Wear Foundation.</p>
<h3 class="h3">9. Cotton can be worse than organic Cotton</h3>
<p>When the production and growth of cotton fabrics take place, thousands of chemical compounds are introduced. They can vary in toxicity, and some of them disappear quickly. However, other chemicals remain in the fabric for the entire lifetime of the fabric. Contrary to this, organic Cotton is free of these harmful chemicals and is environmentally friendly.</p>
