<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-free-fire-players-in-2020.jpg" alt="Top 10 Free-Fire Players In 2020" />

<p>This article features the world's best free-fire player.</p>
<h2 class="h2">1. SK Sabir Boss</h2>
<p>Since this player's prominence primarily lies in India, it's likely that you are unaware of who he is. This well-known Indian YouTuber and streamer have more than 4 million YouTube subscribers.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-free-fire-players-in-20201.png" alt="Top 10 Free-Fire Players In 2020" />
<p>He is committed to playing Free Fire consistently and streaming it to his Twitch Live audience. He is regarded as one of the top players in the competition. He currently maintains one of the top KDAs in the world, yet this is not his most well-known trait.</p>
<p>SK Due to the number of headshots he successfully connects with, Sabir Boss distinguishes himself as one of the top Free Fire players. If you are an expert in Free Fire, you must be aware of how challenging it is to carry out this work frequently. The Indian player, in this instance, plays it as though it were something that came naturally.</p>
<p>He has around 8 million followers on the Booyah platform, in addition to his enormous YouTube following. Additionally, SK Sabir Boss is a member of the legendary Boss guild in the battle royale game.</p>
<p>The Free Fire ID for SK Sabir Boss is 55479535, and his IGN is Boss. In the BR-Ranked mode, the player has completed the Master tier, whereas, in the CS-Ranked version, they have reached the Heroic tier.</p>

<p>Since joining YouTube in 2019, SK Sabir Boss has uploaded slightly over 350 videos. He has received a total of 231.679 million views for this. The gamer got his big break in 2020 when his subscription count increased from a few hundred thousand to over three million by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The player posted only two videos in the preceding 30 days, and there hasn't been much activity on the channel recently. Even still, there has been a 772k rise in his channel views.</p>
<h2 class="h2">2. Raistar</h2>

<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-free-fire-players-in-20202.png" alt="Top 10 Free-Fire Players In 2020" />

<h2 class="h2">3. Jiggs</h2>

<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-free-fire-players-in-20203.png" alt="Top 10 Free-Fire Players In 2020" />
<p>He has one of the best stats among the players in this video game. He typically plays solo and cooperative games. He is regarded as one of the top free-fire players in the world and excels in both categories.</p>
<p>He is not a very active user of social media. You won't find many recent videos of him online, and he isn't very active on live-streaming websites either. His Free Fire Pro settings will provide some direction for you. However, many of them are false due to the lack of information on JIGS.</p>
<p>Jigar Patel is a well-known Indian Free Fire content producer who goes by the in-game moniker "JIGS." He only began his YouTube voyage a few months ago, but already he has amassed a sizable fan base. Additionally, he is the boss of the well-known BOSS guild.</p>

<p>The YouTuber has also participated in 177 duo bouts, where he has defeated his opponents 38 times, keeping a 21.46% win record. He has 443 fragments in his bag and a 3.19 K/D ratio.</p>
<p>In 84 solo matches, the content creator has finished in first place nine times, for a victory rate of 10.71%. He has 106 kills under his belt with a K/D ratio of 1.41.</p>
