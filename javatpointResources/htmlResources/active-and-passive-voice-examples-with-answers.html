<h1 class="h1">Active and Passive Voice Examples with Answers</h1>
<p>In English grammar, the five characteristics of verbs are voices, moods, tenses, persons, and numbers; we're simply concerned with voice here.</p>
<p>The two grammatical voices are active and passive. The type of verb that clearly depicts when a subject performs or is the recipient of action is known as the voice. It is active voice whenever the subject executes the action/ activity and passive voice whenever the subject gets the activity/action.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/english-grammar/images/active-and-passive-voice-examples-with-answers.png" alt="Active and Passive Voice Examples with Answers" />
<h2 class="h2">Active and Passive Voice</h2>
<p>The subject participates in the action in sentences composed in an active voice.</p>
<p>The subject is the beneficiary of the action in passive voice sentences.</p>
<p>Active voice occurs when an activity done by the subject is conveyed through the action word. An active voice is used when a stronger link and clarity between the subject and the action word are required.</p>
<p>Passive voice occurs when the subject obtains the activity conveyed by the action verb. When the performer of the action is unknown, and the focus of the phrase is on the activity rather than the topic, passive voice is used.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Active and Passive Voice Structure</h2>
<p>An active voice sentence is one in which the subject does an activity.</p>
<p><em>It is composed of the following elements: Subject + Verb + Object. </em></p>
<p>The passive voice conveys an action performed on the sentence's topic.</p>
<p>Its structure is as follows: object + verb + subject</p>

</ol>
<p>So, you should now have all of the information you need to make changes to a sentence using Active and Passive Voice formulas and examples in all tenses.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Intransitive Verb Also Cannot Be Transformed in Passive Voice.</h3>
<p>A verb can be transitive or intransitive. The primary difference between the two is that a transitive verb requires an object for it to make complete sense. However, this is not the case in in- transitive they don't really need an object for a sentence to make complete sense. Let us have a look at a few examples;</p>
<p>She sent a gift - This is a transitive verb. Here sent is a transitive verb that requires an object, i.e., a gift, to convey the complete meaning.</p>
<p>Intransitive Verb: She smiles (smiles is an intransitive verb and doesn't need an object to convey the complete meaning). Other examples of intransitive verbs include - laugh, sleep, reach, sit, etc.</p>
<p>So these sentences do not require any object, so hence these cannot be changed into passive voice.</p>
<p>Some of the examples of the same are;</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>She is laughing.</li>
<li>She has gone.</li>
<li>They died in 2020.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Imperative Sentence</h3>
<p>Imperative sentences are those that communicate orders, requests, commands, proposals, and so on. With or without an object, the passive version of imperative phrases begins.</p>
<p>Let + object +be + past participle = passive form (With object).</p>
<p>If a sentence starts with 'You are instructed/ advised/ requested?' use the passive form (no object).</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;. etc. As an example,</p>
<p>active - Take your medication on time.</p>
<p>Passive - You are advised to take medication on time.</p>
<p>Active voice - Let me serve there.</p>
<p>Passive voice- I may be permitted to serve there.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Interrogative Sentence </h3>
<p>Interrogative sentences are those that pose questions. Interrogative phrases in voice can be of two types: with or without a wh group word. If "who" appears in the active voice, it should be changed to "by whom" in the passive form. When there is no Wh word in the active voice, the assisting verb comes before the object because the sentence is interrogative. As an example,</p>
<p><strong>Active -</strong> Who appreciates him ?</p>
<p><strong>Passive -</strong> By whom is he appreciated ?</p>
<p><strong>Active -</strong>Are you attempting the quiz ?</p>
<p><strong>Passive -</strong> Is the quiz being attempted by you ?</p>
