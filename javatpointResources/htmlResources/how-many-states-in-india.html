<p>India is a democratic republic with a Parliamentary system of Government. It is the <strong><em>seventh</em></strong>-<strong><em>largest country in the world</em></strong>. Managing such a big country from one location is not easy, so the Indian Constitution gives the power to the central government to form states with their state governments headed by the Chief Ministers. As of now (2020) after the <strong><em>Jammu and Kashmir became a union territory on 6 August 2019</em></strong>, there are <strong><em>28 states and 8 union territories in India</em></strong>.</p>
