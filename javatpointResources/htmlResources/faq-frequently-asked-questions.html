<h2 class="h2">What to Include in a FAQ Page</h2>
<p>A FAQ page requires constantly improvement and updation. If you want to keep the page meaningful, you can keep adding new questions and answers and updating old ones.</p>
<p>There are various things which you have to keep in your mind regarding what to include in a FAQ page that helps to create an effective FAQ page:</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Use accordions</li>
<li>Common Questions</li>
<li>Keep it short</li>
<li>Categorize</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1. Use Accordions: -</strong> By using the Accordion system, you should create a FAQ page and always avoide long webpage.</p>
<p><strong>2. Common Questions: -</strong> A FAQ page is all about fundamental questions and answers, as the name suggests. You have to gather all the common questions to the customers and then add them to the FAQ page.</p>
<p><strong>3. Keep it Short: -</strong> The question and answer include in the FAQ page must be short so that customers can read it easily.</p>
<p><strong>4. Categorize: -</strong> All the questions and answers include in a FAQ page are arranged and organized category wised.</p>
<h2 class="h2"><strong>When is a FAQ Page Appropriated</strong></h2>
<p>The FAQ page is an essential component of the website, and it can be an asset or threat, but it all depends on how you conduct it.</p>
<p>But to make sure it is later, there are various hints that it is time to add a FAQ as a part of your website:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>When customers contact you regularly with the same concerns, it is best to answer them prominently and openly.</li>
<li>You have or intended to build content/landing pages that you can connect from query to conversations and continue the journey.</li>
<li>Your business/product/service raises issues and problems that are answered most easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>The third point is particularly relevant because a FAQ page provides a unique opportunity to resolve issues directly and eliminate barriers on the purchase path.</p>
<h2 class="h2">FAQ Page Design</h2>
<p>There are various points which you have to consider while designing the FAQ page for your website:</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Include a search bar</li>
<li>Link top questions</li>
<li>Write clear and concise pages</li>
<li>Stick to the basics</li>
<li>Organize questions by category</li>
<li>Regularly update each page</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1. Include a Search Bar: -</strong> Although listing all the FAQ questions on one page and linking or connecting them from a landing page is helpful, this complex format can end up being boring for many customers. Sometimes with a single question in mind, clients come to a FAQ page and are forced to click through hundreds of other questions to answer their questions.</p>
<p>If the customers have access to the search bar, their query or related keywords can be easily searched to save time.</p>
<p><strong>2. Link Top Questions: -</strong> If you have a category laid out in your FAQ section's landing page, then it is good. Although several questions are likely more popular than other questions. It is better if these such top questions must have their sector, and the link of the answer to these questions is placed at the top side of the FAQ page so that time of the customers can be saved. In this way, we can preserve our hierarchical organization by making the most frequently asked questions more available.</p>
<p><strong>3. Write Concise and Clear Pages: -</strong> Another thing which you have to keep in your mind while creating a FAQ page is the FAQ page must be concise and precise because if the FAQ page contains a vast text, then it confuse the reader and due to this reader need to search for the responses they require. So, instead of writing a long paragraph, it is better to provide concise and straightforward answers.</p>
<p><strong>4. Stick to the Basics: -</strong> You may want your FAQ pages to be lightened with the theme, colors, etc. It can be useful for the company and its branding, but it is not entertaining customers on your FAQ pages. The FAQ page format must be in a simple design so that reader can read this easily.</p>
<p><strong>5. Organize Questions by Category: -</strong> If in the FAQ page section, you organize each question based on the category, then the customer gets a fast response to their question because if all the questions are arranged in a random order, then sometimes the customer might be frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>6. Regularly Update Each Page: -</strong> Each FAQ page which you have must be always correct. When your company faces product releases and updates, these changes must be reflected in your FAQ page. This means that the team needs to regularly review each page and update it as new features are introduced.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Where to Place a FAQ Page</h2>
<p>Where to place a FAQ page is also an essential task, just like creating a FAQ page is important. Although there are various tech-savvy folks who search link of the FAQ in the website's footer and there are various people who don't have an idea related to the FAQ pages. And it is your responsibility to make their finding for your FAQs page easier for them.</p>
<p>For example: - A business or product website's pricing page is an excellent place to put a FAQ page because it is that place where customers have come mostly with the questions related to the plans, features, and pricing.</p>
<p>If below the pricing table, you placed the FAQ section, it helps you save a lot of trouble that responding to common product questions. Other great options for adding a FAQ section are the contact page, help page, how it works page, and the page of product sales.</p>

<h2 class="h2">How to Make an FAQ Page</h2>
<p>There are various steps to make an effective FAQ page:</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Determine the questions</li>
<li>Categorize the questions</li>
<li>Highlight or link most popular questions</li>
<li>Include a search bar</li>
<li>Align with your brand look and feel</li>
<li>Update regularly</li>
<li>Track and improve</li>
</ol>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/blog/images/faq-frequently-asked-questions15.png" alt="Frequently Asked Questions" />
<p><strong>1. Determine the Questions: -</strong> If your business is already present, then there will be plenty of questions to get you started either in your inbox or in the inbox of your customer service head as a jump-off point using it and make a long list of questions. In the list, there will be no question of dumb type because the chances are that if one person thinks it, then there is also a community of people out in the world who think is too.</p>
<p>If from scratch, you are creating a business, then you have to note down all the questions related to the product that the customers can ask. Build a group and ask the individual to check the product, and when they checked the product, you ask the question to individuals related to their experience of the product.</p>
<p>You have to make sure that the questions on the FAQ page are relevant to the specific product. And that these questions should make customers purchase once when they find the answers. Always have a constructive context to your questions.</p>
<p><strong>2. Categorize the Questions: -</strong> Determine similarity themes within your question list, and start grouping the questions on the basis of the similarity.</p>
<p>Similar categories contain:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Products,</li>
<li>Your account</li>
<li>Sizing</li>
<li>Shipping and returns</li>
<li>Promotions and discounts</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Payments</li>
</ul>
<p>If the questions are arranged in a random order, then customers will frustrate. But if you arranged the questions based on the category, it will help the customers get the searching answers easily.</p>
<p><strong>3. Highlight or Link Most Popular Questions: -</strong> For a reason, they are known as frequently asked questions. Make sure that every question will refer to many peoples.</p>
<p>For example, "what I do if my pet steals my shirt," would not be a great FAQ. An excellent FAQ provides you the detail regarding the product and the consistency of the fabric used to diminish the tears.</p>
<p>After determining the most popular questions, your next task is to highlight the most popular questions and put them into the starting of the FAQ page. Emphasizing these questions would lead to better customer experience because most shoppers will only need those responses.</p>
<p><strong>4. Include a Search Bar: -</strong> If you include a search bar in the FAQ page, then it will help the customer to save time because if there is a search bar in the FAQ page then the customer can get the answers of their question by searching the questions on the search bar, and there is no need to search the answers in the long list of the questions. If there is no search bar on the FAQ page, then the customers can be frustrated and confused with the user experience.</p>
<p><strong>5. Align with your Brand Look and Feel: -</strong> It's weird when you are visiting a pleasantly designed site of e-commerce, and then you click on the FAQ page and look like a design of 90's. It is true that the FAQ page should not be over-designed. But must add some brand components so that when customers visit the FAQ page, they feel like they are in a similar era. So, designing the FAQ page is also an important task so that the customers can feel that the FAQ page is also an important part, just like a website.</p>
<p><strong>6. Update Regularly: -</strong> For the customers, an out-of-date FAQ page can be more annoying than getting a FAQ at all. So, if you add some new features in your product or service, then it is a must that your FAQ page with the new question should also be updated.</p>
<p>It is important to check your FAQ page regularly so that you can determine whether any improvements need to be made or not. Sometimes various questions are essential, so it is important to move these questions at the top of the FAQ page. Sometimes you can change the method of payment and have to update those terms. So, no matter whether the change is small or big, make sure your FAQ page reflects the changes.</p>
<p><strong>7. Track and Improve: -</strong> As already discussed that how the FAQ page could give insights above, but if you want to gather those insights, then you have to monitor the traffic and click on the page. Note the things in the order in which the customer clicked on the questions and how they came to your FAQ page.</p>
<p>The actions taken on your FAQ page will assist in informing your marketing strategy and the team of your product can improve the product or service on the basis of your page review. Looping is also a better way in software engineers because they are able to change the user experience based on the feedback that you collect.</p>
