<h1 class="h1">Virat Kohli</h1>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/biography/images/virat-kohli.png" class="imageright" alt="Virat Kohli" />
<p>Virat Kholi, the present Captain of the Indian cricket team, is one of the world's best right-hand batsmen. He was born on <strong>5<sup>th</sup></strong> November <strong>1988</strong> in Delhi, India. His nickname is <strong>Cheeku</strong>. Kholi's father, <strong>Prem Kohli</strong>, was a criminal lawyer. And <strong>Saroj Kholi</strong>, his mother, is a housewife. Kholi has two siblings, the elder brother <strong>Vikash</strong> and the elder sister <strong>Bhavna.</strong></p>
<h3 class="h3">Early life</h3>
<p>Kholi was brought up in Uttam Nagar and did his schooling at <strong>Vishal Bharti public school</strong>. At a very early stage, about <strong>9</strong> years old, Kholi becomes part of West Delhi Cricket Academy. There he was trained by the trainer Rajkumar Sharma. Later he joined Saviour Convent for his cricket. Kholi was not only talented in cricket, but he was also very good in academics. In <strong>2006</strong> his father died of a stroke. After that, in <strong>2015</strong>, with his family, Kholi moved to Gurgaon.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Career</h3>
<p>Virat Kholi was selected in the Delhi <strong>under-15</strong> team for the Polly Umrigar trophy in <strong>2002-2003.</strong> In that tournament, he scored the highest run and became the Captain of the team for <strong>the 2003-2004</strong> tournaments. The same year (<strong>2004</strong>), he was selected in the Delhi <strong>under-17</strong> team. There, his team won the Vijay merchant tournament (<strong>2004-2005</strong>), and again Kohli was the highest run-scorer. In July <strong>2006</strong>, he played for India <strong>under-19</strong> team. There, his team won both ODI and test series against England. His performance was appreciated by Coach <strong>Lalchand Rajput</strong>. In November <strong>2006</strong>, he played his debut match against Tamil Nadu for Delhi. The same year in the month of December, when his father died, the very next day, he played against Karnataka and scored <strong>90</strong>. His father's death at Kholi's very young stage was a shock to him. After that, he made his father's dream his own dream and never looked back. His mother said that "<em>Virat changed a bit after that day. Overnight he became a much more matured person. He took every match seriously. He hated being on the bench. It's as if his life hinged totally on cricket after that day. Now, he looked like he was chasing his father's dream which was his own too."</em></p>
<p>In April <strong>2007,</strong> he was the highest scorer of the inter-state <strong>T20</strong> championship. In <strong>2008</strong> India won the under-19 cricket World Cup in Malaysia under the captaincy of Virat Kholi. In that tournament, he was the third-highest scorer. After this, Kholi played several under-19 tournaments and won the matches. After the under-19 World Cup, Royal Challengers Banglore of IPL Indian Premier League bought Kohli for <strong>$30,000</strong>. He was awarded the <strong>Border- Gavaskar scholarship</strong> that allowed him to train at Cricket Australia's centre of excellence in Brisbane for six weeks. In <strong>2008</strong> he was selected in the Indian ODI for the Sri Lanka tour as well as for the champions' trophy in Pakistan. On the Sri Lanka tour, he played as an opener batsman, and this was his first international match. And India also won its first ODI series against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka. After that, Kohli got the chance to India a team and played several tournaments. And finally, it was December <strong>2008</strong> when he got the annual BCCI grade D contract that entitled him to receive Rs <strong>1.5</strong> million.</p>
<p>In <strong>2009</strong> he was selected for India emerging player's tournament. He played as an opener batsman in the matches and scored the highest of <strong>398</strong> runs. This tournament was the turning point of Kohli's career, and he was also praised by the Chairman of the national selection committee, <strong>Kris Srikkanth</strong>. Further, the same year in the ICC champions trophy, he batted at number <strong>4</strong> at the place of Yuvraj Singh and got the man of the match award. His first ODI century was against Srilanka in <strong>2009,</strong> in which he scored <strong>107</strong> of <strong>114</strong> balls. His second century was against Bangladesh in <strong>2010</strong> in a tri-national ODI tournament in Bangladesh. He was also the highest scorer of that series with <strong>275</strong> runs. He was the third Indian batsman who scored two ODI centuries at an early age as before <strong>22</strong>. Before him, it was Tendulkar and Dhoni who scored 2 ODI centuries at an early age.</p>
<p>Further, the same year (<strong>2010)</strong>, he became the Vice Captain for a tri-series (May-June) in Zimbabwe. However, India lost the series, but he became the fastest Indian batsman to score <strong>1000</strong> runs in ODI.</p>
<p>After that, for a period, he struggled with his form, and he retained it with his third ODI century <strong>118</strong> off <strong>121</strong> balls in a series against Australia at Visakhapatnam in October <strong>2010.</strong> His fourth ODI century was against New Zealand in the same year. And he became the highest scorer in ODIs (<strong>2010</strong>) with <strong>995</strong> runs in <strong>25</strong> matches. After this, match by match with his performances, he got rank <strong>2</strong> batsmen in ICC ranking.</p>
<p>Further, he was selected for the World Cup <strong>2011</strong> and played in all the matches. he scored his fifth ODI century in his first match of the world cup against Bangladesh, which made him the first Indian batsman for such achievement. In the final match of the world cup, he played a good partnership with Gambhir that made it possible for India to win the World Cup after <strong>the 1983</strong> World Cup. After the success of the World Cup, he played his test debut at Kingston in June-July <strong>2021,</strong> when India toured West Indies for one-day and test series. But there in the test series, he struggled with his performance, due to which first he was dropped from the next test series of July-August in England. But later, due to the injury of Yuvraj Singh, he was recalled. After that, in all ODI series, he gave his best performance and scored the highest run in ODIs for the year <strong>2011</strong> (1381 in 34 matches).</p>
<p>Now with his consistent performance, he got a place in the test series and toured Australia in December <strong>2011</strong>. However, India lost that test series, but he was the highest Indian scorer of that series as well as he scored his first test century (116 runs) in the first inning of the fourth match of that series.</p>
<p>Further, in the Commonwealth Bank triangular series (February 2021) in Australia, Kholi was the highest Indian scorer as well as the only Indian batsman who scored a century in the series. However, India lost that series, but for his nice performance in that series, Kohli has appointed the vice-captain for Asia cup <strong>2012</strong>, which was going to be in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>In that tournament, too, he was the highest scorer with <strong>357</strong> runs. In the last group match of the tournament, he scored <strong>183</strong> against Pakistan, which was his <strong>11<sup>th</sup></strong> ODI century, as well as the highest individual score in the Asia cup that broke the record of Younis Khan (144) in <strong>2004</strong>. Kohli was awarded the man of the match in two matches of the tournament. However, India could not qualify for the final of the tournament. In the same year <strong>(2012)</strong>, Kohli played several other matches and series and got the man of the match and man of the series awards. At the time of ICC World Cup twenty20 in 2012, he was the highest Indian scorer with 185 runs and was awarded ICC 'Team of the Tournament. Match by match, Kholi was improving and also showing his growing maturity in the game. <strong>Viv Richards</strong> (former west indies captain) said:</p>
<blockquote>I love watching virat kohli bat. He looks to me like an individual of my own heart. I love his aggression, and [he has] serious passion that I used to have. He reminds me of myself.</blockquote>
<p>Later in a triangular series in the West Indies, Kholi played as the Captain when Dhoni was injured in the first match of the series. He scored his first century (<strong>102</strong> off <strong>83</strong> balls) as a CAPTAIN against West Indies in that series. Further, in July <strong>2013</strong>, when most of the senior players were rested for the ODI Zimbabwe tour, Kholi was the first time appointed as the Captain for the whole series. India won that series <strong>5-0.</strong> After that, in the second match of an ODI series against Australia in Jaipur, Kohli scored <strong>100</strong> in just <strong>52</strong> balls that were the fastest century against Australia. In the <strong>sixth</strong> match of that series, he scored <strong>115</strong> in just <strong>66</strong> balls in which made 100 in <strong>61</strong> balls which was the third fastest-ODI century by an Indian batsman. With this century, Kholi also became the fastest batsman in the world to score 17 hundreds in ODI. After this series, Kohli also reached the top rank in ICC ODI batsmen rankings. In other ODI series, Kohli equalled Viv Richards with becoming the fastest batsman to make <strong>5000</strong> runs in <strong>114</strong> innings in ODI Cricket. He was also the man of the series for scoring the highest run (<strong>204)</strong>.</p>
<p>Further, Kohli toured for several series, and in almost all matches, he showed his consistent performance. In <strong>the 2014</strong> ICC <strong>World T20</strong>, he was the Vice-Captain of the Indian team. In all matches, he played very well, especially in the semi-final he scored <strong>74</strong> in <strong>44</strong> balls. For that, he got the man of the match and said, "<em>my best twanty20 innings</em>". Even in the final match, he scored <strong>77</strong> from <strong>58</strong> balls against Srilanka. However, India lost that match. Kohli scored <strong>319</strong> runs in that tournament that was the highest individual score. For that, he won the award of the man of the tournament.</p>
<p>After that, for a period of time, Kohli struggled with his form, and many questions arose on his technique. In the test and ODI series against England, he struggled much. But later in October 2014, in-home ODI series, he got his form back. He scored his <strong>20<sup>th</sup></strong> ODI century <strong>127</strong> in <strong>114</strong> balls in the <strong>4<sup>th</sup></strong> match of the series. After that, in November, for an ODI series against Srilanka, Dhoni was rested, and Kohli captained the full series. In the fifth match of the series, he scored unbeaten <strong>139</strong> off <strong>126</strong> balls and won the series with <strong>5-0.</strong> He got the player of the series. This was the second whitewash under his captaincy. At that time, Kholi also became the fastest batsman in the world to cross <strong>6000</strong> in ODIs. He also became the second player in the world for making more than <strong>1000 runs in 4 consecutive</strong> years.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Kohli got test captaincy</h2>
<p>In December <strong>2014</strong>, for the Australian tour, Kohli got test captaincy due to Dhoni's injury. However, Dhoni returned to the team as Captain from the second match of the series, but at the last of the third match of the series, Dhoni announced his retirement from Test Cricket, and Kohli became the full-time Captain for the test team. As a captain of the test team, he gave his best performance in all the matches. He scored <strong>692</strong> in all four matches that were the highest by an Indian batsman in test series in Australia.</p>
<p>After that, in World Cup 2015, Kohli performed well. However, India was eliminated by Australia in the semi-final.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Kohli's performances as a captain as of 28<sup>th</sup> September 2021</h2>
<p><strong>Test</strong>: Kholi captained <strong>65</strong> test matches in which he won <strong>38</strong> matches and lost <strong>16</strong> matches. Eleven matches were drawn.</p>
<p><strong>ODI</strong>: Kohli captained <strong>95</strong> ODI matches in which he won <strong>65</strong> matches and lost <strong>27</strong> matches. One match was tied, and there was no result of <strong>2</strong> matches.</p>
<p><strong>T20I</strong>: Kohli captained <strong>45 twenty20</strong> matches in which he won <strong>27</strong>matches and lost <strong>14</strong> matches. <strong>2</strong> matches were tied, and there was no result of <strong>2</strong> matches.</p>
<p>In <strong>the 2016</strong> ICC World, T20 Kohli scored <strong>273</strong> runs in <strong>5</strong> matches. However, in the semi-final, in spite of his top-scored <strong>89</strong> from <strong>47</strong> balls, India lost the match by the west indies and India's campaign was ended. But Kohli got the awards of the man of the tournament as well as the Captain of the 'team of the tournament' by ICC.</p>
<p>In October <strong>2017</strong>, Kholi made new records of the highest <strong>8888</strong> runs with <strong>31</strong> centuries in <strong>200</strong> ODI matches. The ICC appoint Kohli as Captain of their world test <strong>XI</strong> and ODI XI for <strong>2017</strong>. In <strong>2018</strong> in the series against West Indies, Kholi completed his <strong>10000</strong> ODI runs in <strong>205</strong> matches. He was the fastest and <strong>12<sup>th</sup></strong> batsman for making such records. He made that record in <strong>205</strong> matches which were <strong>54</strong> matches less than the next fastest Sachin Tendulkar. In the same year (<strong>2018</strong>,) in his captaincy, Kohli won the test series in Australia and became the first Indian as well as the first Asian Captain to win the test series in Australia. And again, he was appointed the Captain of world Test <strong>XI</strong> and ODI <strong>XI</strong> by ICC.</p>
<p>Kholi captained the Indian team in the <strong>2019</strong> cricket World Cup. In June <strong>2019,</strong> in a match against West Indies, he completed <strong>20000</strong> runs in <strong>417</strong> international matches that were the fastest by any batsman.</p>
<p>At the starting of 2020, India toured New Zealand, but in that tour, Kholi struggled with his performances, and that tour was a disastrous tour under Kholi captaincy. India lost all its matches.</p>
<p>In India tour to Australia during <strong>2020-2021</strong>, India lost the ODI series but won the T20I series in which Kholi was the highest scorer. In the test series, after the first test, Kohli took paternity leave as he was expecting his first child and left the series in between. For this decision, he was criticized much by Gavaskar and Kapil Dev. But in spite of his absence in the captaincy of Ajinky Rahane, India won the series.</p>
<p>After that, in June 2021, in Kohli captaincy, India lost the <strong>2021</strong> ICC world test championship final by New Zealand. In September, he was announced as a captain for <strong>the 2021</strong> ICC men's t20 World Cup. But later, Kohli was announced for quitting India's T20I captaincy.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Kohli's style</h2>
<p>Virat Kohli is an aggressive right-hand batsman. Usually, He played at number <strong>3.</strong> He is famous for his wide range of shots, as well as for his capability to bat under pressure. Although the cover drive is his favourite shot, his natural shot is a flick shot. He was appreciated by his team for his confidence, commitment, focus and work ethic. He is also known as a sharp filder. He is a good chaser as he plays well at the time of chasing another team. He said himself, "I<em> love the whole situation that comes with chasing.
