<p>Group discussion or GD is a form of a discussion between people forming a group. People in the group discussion are connected with one basic idea. Based on that idea, everyone in the group represents his/her perspective. The recruiters use it to hire the best talent among various candidates.</p>

<p>Group discussion is not only a discussion to be practiced while going for an interview in an organization or a university. It is a type of discussion that can be practiced at any age. There is no particular topic or criteria. A group of friends can also practice such type of discussions by selecting a random topic. But, what is the benefit of these Group Discussions at an early age?</p>
<p>There are lots of advantages of these discussions at an early age. It includes <strong>enhanced confidence, elimination of hesitation, improved communications skills, better friendship bonds, happiness, thoughts sharing, improved knowledge, improved coordination</strong>, and many more. But, these improvements are not a single step process. It improves as we keep practicing. It is not only the usual discussion, but it is also a discussion with knowledge and facts.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Why did group discussion started?</h2>
<p>During the initial days, group discussion was popular only in few organizations. But, with the increase in competition among students, it became a part of every organization. Today, in colleges or universities a special lecture is provided to the students to enhance these skills. It is also known as the <strong>Personality development</strong> class.</p>
<p>Group Discussion tests the personality skills, communication skills, teamwork, confidence, problem-solving skills, social skills, behavior, and leadership abilities of a candidate. It also checks the on-spot preparation of a candidate in a short time span.</p>
<p>It is used as a quick method to shortlist a few candidates from the massive strength.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a candidate fails in office or professional meetings, presentations, etc. He/she might have scored the top rank, but unable to speak confidently in such professional meetings create a negative impression. Hence, it is now adopted as an exam to pass before joining any university or organization.</p>
<p>Is there any importance of conducting a practicing a Group Discussion?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, let's discuss the importance of Group discussion.</p>

<p>Group discussion is like one of the exams that a candidate needs to qualify. Group discussion topics give us an idea about the trending topics and related information. It increases our knowledge and confidence in speaking. These topics help us to prepare well so that we can perform better in the GD round.</p>
<p>Candidates who perform well among other students in a group are shortlisted. The given topic can have a different perspective depending on the candidate. A candidate may be in favor of a topic, while another is against it. The practice gives us an idea about the correct perspective about a particular topic.</p>
<p>Hence, it is important to practice various Group discussion topics to improve our communication, fluency, problem-solving skills, confidence, and general awareness.</p>
<h2 class="h2">What is the basic frame of a GD?</h2>
<p>Let's discuss the procedure of a group discussion.</p>
<p>A topic prior a group discussion is provided to the group of candidates ranging from 5 to 15. The candidates can vary depending on the available strength. If the strength if high, the number of candidates can also increase. If the strength is low, it can be 5 to 7.</p>
<p>The preparation time of around 5 minutes is given to a group before beginning with the discussion. The duration of a group discussion is 15 minutes. In case studies, the duration can be 45 minutes. Sometimes, the panelist or judges can extend the discussion for more than <strong>15 minutes</strong>. They can also end the discussion in between. The participants should not consider any assumption that the GD will be conducted only for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>A candidate among the group who has is confident can initiate the discussion. It is not pre-known that who will start. Anyone can initiate the discussion. As soon as a candidate starts, the next candidate begins expressing his/her perspective about that topic. Similarly, everyone needs to express his/her views.</p>
<p>The panelists or judges can ask anyone to conclude the discussion at last. Hence, everyone needs to be active during the discussion.</p>

<p>How to prevent a third wave of covid in India?</p>
<p>Covid vaccination</p>
<h3 class="h3">Second wave of Covid-19 in India</h3>
<p>The COVID has affected the way we live, learn, and work. It has resulted in the decline of faith in a life of a human being. Many of us have felt the crisis. Some of us have also lost our loved ones. The second wave of Covid-19 brought the Delta variant that claimed many lives compared to the first wave.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The country's weak health infrastructure has been under pressure due to the sudden rise in the covid cases.</li>
<li>Most people claimed their lives due to unavailability of medical facilities and oxygen supply.</li>
<li>But, the recovery rate of India was later increased upto 95%. Due to the large population, rest 5% also contributes to the large number who suffered during the crisis.</li>
<li>The post-covid second wave also introduced black fungus, white fungus, and other virus types whose mortality rate was even higher than the covid.</li>
<li>Those who recovered are somewhere affected internally by the covid. They are also in need of the medical care.</li>
<li>After the second, India is also planning for the upcoming third wave. Proactive measures have been taken to build a resilient healthcare system. It is also essential for people to get vaccinated as soon as possible by the end of the year 2021.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Changes in India's economy in the year 2020-2021</h3>
<p>The covid crisis has increased the percentage of poor in the country. It has resulted in the loss of jobs, etc. Various sectors of the economy, such as <strong>railways, airlines, tourism,</strong> and <strong>transportation,</strong> have suffered a loss due to the lockdown and prevention measures from the virus.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The impact on the economy was less severe as compared to the first wave of covid. People were better adapted to the situations in the lockdown. Online orders, digital systems, etc. was on work during the pandemic.</li>
<li>India has saw around four lakhs cases per day during the peak of covid during the second wave. It has claimed multiple lives especially the young.</li>
<li>India has lost control of the supply of oxygen and medicines, and hospital beds due to the rising demand and short supply. The second wave has also claimed the lives of government employees, doctors, police officers, and many more.</li>
<li>In terms of the economy, we can also say that the covid crisis has made the rich richer and poorer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Kharif strategy for oil seeds</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>The welfare strategy adopted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers to achieve the adequate production of oil seeds.</li>
<li>According to the Kharif strategy, the government has approved a plan to distribute free oil seeds to the farmers during the Kharif season in 2021 in the form of mini-kits.</li>
<li>But, the availability of these seeds during the pandemic will be a challenge. The initiative was developed to make the country self-dependent in oilseeds production.</li>
<li>The program is likely to produce round 120 lakhs quintals of oilseeds and 24 lakhs quintals of the edible oil. It will thus put the country towards Atman Nirbhay Bharat in the production of oilseeds.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">India's refugee policy</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>The issue of refugees in India is present since Independence. In 2021, hundreds of people crossed the border and entered Mizoram and adjoining states in violence towards protestors by the military rulers in Myanmar.</li>
<li>The Union Ministry issued instructions to prohibit them from declaring the refuges of the country. Such refugees create an economic, social, and religious impact on the area's local people.</li>
<li>There is a need to clearly define the migrants and the illegal migrant to prevent any debate or confusion.</li>
<li>A dedicated refugee policy is required with appropriate instructions to safeguard their fundamental human rights.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Single-use plastic</h3>
<p>Single-use plastic is the type of plastic that is disposed of once after use. Examples of such types of plastic are food packaging materials, plastic polythene bags, straws, etc.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The single-use plastic is alone responsible for more than 50 percent of marine pollution.</li>
<li>These types of plastic are not degradable and pollute the soil and water.</li>
<li>But, various nations are taking steps to control the water pollution and the reduction of the use of such type of plastics.</li>
<li>There is also a need of a global initiative to make the world plastic-free in the near future. In addition, public awareness is also essential to persuade people to prohibit the use of single-use plastics.</li>
<li>More research will also help create and dispose of these types of plastics without harming nature and the Earth.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Data protection in India</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>Data is the collection of information that is generally stored in the computer or the cloud network. Data protection refers to the safeguard of the user information to protect it from misuse, loss, or distortion.</li>
<li>The Information Technology act (IT act), 2000 regulates the entities that collect and process personal user's data in India. It fails to provide effective protection to the user's data.</li>
<li>The privacy policy is a fundamental right, but the country's people are still waiting for a law. The recent Whatsapp privacy policy has also enacted India to enact the law without any further delay.</li>
<li>The recent ban of the Chinese apps and the leakage of data during the pandemic strongly demands the strong data policy in India.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Fuel prices at a record high</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>Fuel prices are at a record high in India. The petrol price in June 2021 surpassed rupees 96. The high rate has reduced the consumption of petrol in India.</li>
<li>Fuel prices n Mumbai have crossed rupees 102.82 per liter. Thus, petrol and diesel prices have increased in most of the cities of the country.</li>
<li>The covid-19 situation has resulted in the sudden fall of the oil demand in India. It is due to the higher global crude oil prices. The rising fuel prices may even worsen the situation.</li>
<li>Low-income people are severely affected by rising fuel prices.</li>
<li>It has also resulted in the increase use of electric vehicles. A single fully charge electric battery can be used to travel around 80 to 100km.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Covid self-testing kit</h3>
<p>The covid self kid is developed by MyLab Discovery, which is now easily available online through e-commerce websites and in the market. It cost only rupees 250. Anyone irrespective of age can buy this to detect the presence of covid virus in the body.</p>
<p>It takes on2 minutes to conduct the test with jut simple steps mentioned on the kit. The result takes 15 minutes and the report can be seen through the app after 15 minutes. The self kit was special prepared to reduce the spread of covid by testing at home. It was also developed for the rural areas where frequent testing of covid was not possible.</p>
<h3 class="h3">How to prevent the third wave of covid in India?</h3>
<p>The third wave in India is expected to peak between October and November 2021. The variant of the spread of the third wave is commonly known as the Delta Plus variant. There are other variants, such as delta (second wave), lambda, etc. As of June 2021, the lambda variant is not yet detected in India, but it has been found in 30 other countries.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The first essential step is to take the <strong>vaccine</strong>. In India, most of the vaccination campaigns are free of cost. Hence, everyone should take the vaccination dose as soon as possible. It is only important prevention from the deadly virus.</li>
<li>Our behavior is also a type of vaccine. We need to wash hands often, keep our mouth and nose covered properly with the mask, and do not touch any external surface or face. Keep the places also sanitized. Maintain social distance while talking to people.</li>
<li>Avoid going to a crowded place. Work from home is also a method to reduce crowding at workplaces and markets.</li>
<li>Local cases are the base of the spread of coronavirus. The fresh covid cases should be treated at a local level. It will prevent the further spread of the virus in the adjacent areas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Covid Vaccination</h3>
<p>India started two vaccination doses, namely Serum Institute of India <strong>Covidshield</strong> and Bharat Biotech's <strong>Covaxin</strong>. The covid vaccination is responsible for creating <strong>antibodies</strong> in the human body that fight from the severity of coronavirus. The vaccine is being manufactured not only for India but for other countries as well.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>There are <strong>two doses</strong> for the successful covid vaccination. The second dose of the Covishield and Covaxin vaccine is given between the gaps of 6 weeks to 12 weeks.</li>
<li>Serum Institute decided to manufacture vaccine in India due to the superlative manufacturing capacity of the country.</li>
<li>India is currently contributing 90% of its manufactured vaccines to other countries, such as Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, etc.</li>
<li>India is the only manufacturer of the vaccination, but Oxford originally built the sample. It is named as Astra-Zeneca vaccine. The patent to manufacture vaccine was given to the Serum Institute.</li>
<li>Pfizer and Moderna are the vaccines currently being used in the Canada.</li>
<li>AstraZeneca and Novavax are the vaccines currently being used in USA. AstraZeneca has also been approved in the UK.</li>
