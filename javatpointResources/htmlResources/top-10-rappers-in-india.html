<h1 class="h1">Top 10 Rappers In India</h1>
<p>India has a long history of being praised for its rich cultural heritage, amazing music and dance styles, and unique mingling of cultures. However, as time has passed, changes and development that no one could have anticipated have happened. While the classics will always be valuable, new dance, art, and music genres are always being introduced, and individuals are upgrading their practices by trying to blend with many cultures! Rap music is one of the twenty-first century's most popular and quickly expanding musical subgenres. In 1990, the Punjabi musician <strong><em>Baba Sehgal</em></strong> introduced hip-hop to India. With songs like "<strong><em>Thanda Thanda Paani"</em></strong> and "<strong><em>Dil Dhadke</em></strong>," <strong><em>Harjeet Singh Sehgal,</em></strong> sometimes referred to as Baba Sehgal, helped popularise rap and hip-hop. Then, in the early 2000s, the California-based rapper <strong><em>Bohemia (Roger David</em></strong>), a Pakistani-American, sparked the Indian Hip Hop genre. ShaOne, a hip-hop producer, assisted Bohemia in releasing his debut album "<strong><em>Vich Pardesan De</em></strong>" (Seth Agress). He quickly rose to fame after publishing "<strong><em>Pesa Nasha Pyar</em></strong>," the first full-length Punjabi rap album, which was an immediate hit in India.</p>
<p>Hip-hop music's rap style was developed in the 1970s by African Americans and Latinos in the United States. The people of that era suffered from pervasive inequality and were denied the ability to express their concerns. Rap was one of the ways they discovered to spread it, along with other types of art. Rap used to be a revolutionary movement component and a means of communicating about struggle. Rap became a platform for people to express their hardships only via art.</p>
<p>Rappers have become increasingly important in the music industry, and their numbers have increased significantly in India. People appreciate rap because they enjoy listening to topics they can relate to. They resonate with listeners because they are relevant to what rappers are talking about. It encourages people to believe those good things can emerge from hardship, a notion that rapping has always stood for. Rap music, in summary, is the ideal fusion of inspiration and fun. Young generations may now believe in their aspirations thanks to rap artists. More people want to become rappers.</p>
<h2 class="h2">1. Raftaar</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-rappers-in-india1.png" alt="Top 10 Rappers In India" />
<p><strong><em>Dilin Nair</em></strong> is an Indian rapper, songwriter, dancer, TV personality, and music composer best known by his stage name Raftaar. His work is most closely associated with Hindi and Punjabi music. He was born on <strong><em>November 16, 1988.</em></strong></p>
<p>He began his rap career in 2008 by producing music alongside <strong><em>Lil Golu</em></strong> and Young <strong><em>Amli</em></strong> and sharing it online (now known as Ikka). Raftaar was born to Malayali parents from Delhi in Trivandrum (now Thiruvananthapuram), Kerala. Raftaar wed <strong><em>Komal Vohra</em></strong> in December 2016, the sister of Indian television stars <strong><em>Karan Vohra and Kunal Vohra.</em></strong> They started living apart in 2020 and filed for divorce. Due to the COVID epidemic, the legal processes were postponed. After Manj Musik launched his song <strong><em>"Swag Mera Desi"</em></strong> in 2013, Raftaar gained popularity. When he was a kid, his family used it to listen to <strong><em>Michael Jackson</em></strong>, inspiring him to hustle. He downloaded a wide variety of music, including tracks by <strong><em>Eminem and Linkin Park</em></strong>, to sell as MP3s for Rs at school. He then began instructing students in dance! Yes, this rapper initially started dancing before rapping. He started combining several songs to create medleys in the early days of his YouTube research. This was the start of his musical and rap career. He began penning Punjabi songs under the pen name Dilin, but through time, he evolved into the Raftaar that everyone is familiar with-the author of memoirs.</p>
<h2 class="h2">2. Emiway Bantai</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-rappers-in-india2.png" alt="Top 10 Rappers In India" />
<p>Emiway is a rapper who, in real life, goes by the name <strong><em>Bilal Shaikh</em></strong>. He lives in Antop Hill, as evidenced by the fact that several of his tracks rhythmically depict his Pincode <strong><em>"Mumbai 47."</em></strong> Emiway comes from a Karnataka-based, middle-class family of observant Muslims. His stage moniker, <strong><em>"Emiway</em></strong>," was created by fusing the initials of <strong><em>Eminem</em></strong> and <strong><em>Lil Wayne,</em></strong> or <strong><em>Emi+Way</em></strong>. He had to put in much effort to study hip-hop music. He began creating rap videos in 2014 as a hobby, but after receiving an amazing response, he began to take rap music seriously. He released the English version of "<strong><em>Glint Lock,"</em></strong> his debut YouTube song, alongside Minta in 2013. He worked as a worker at the "<strong><em>Hard Rock Cafe</em></strong>" throughout the early years of his career as a rapper to make money for his music without needing financial assistance from his family. It so happened that he earned the <strong><em>Radio City Freedom Award</em></strong> there a few years later. He used to rap first in English, but his father advised him to attempt it in Hindi so that the average Indian could readily comprehend it. In addition, his father, who appeared in one of his videos, had long aspired to be an actor. His debut Hindi rap, <strong><em>"Aur Bantai,"</em></strong> which he released in 2014, became an immediate smash.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bantai The Studio</em></strong> is the name of his own music studio. Bantai had previously participated in India's Got Talent, a well-known reality talent competition, before being well-known. <strong><em>Emiway and Bantai</em></strong> are derived from the streets of Bombay and Eminem and Lil Wayne, respectively. The rapper and composer from Mumbai began composing music in 2013 and has now amassed over 3 billion listens on his over 150-song discography, all done independently. Nearly 2 years later, in 2017, he worked with Raftaar on the song "#<strong><em>Sadak,"</em></strong> which was his much-needed breakthrough.</p>
<h2 class="h2">3. Divine</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-rappers-in-india3.png" alt="Top 10 Rappers In India" />
<p>Rappers are familiar with the Gully boy rapper Divine. His tale began at a young age and is similar to that of other rappers today, with the exception that his style of music is similar to that of color rappers from the west, who create songs about their histories. Divine, the "<strong><em>Voice of the Street,"</em></strong> was conceived by a mother who worked abroad and an alcoholic father. In one of his songs, he expresses his desire to bring his mother back from overseas and for her to stop working more so they could be together. At one time in his history, he was involved in the drug trade, which he freely acknowledges as one of the lowest points of his life.</p>
<p>Rapper <strong><em>Vivian Wilson Fernandes,</em></strong> also known as <strong><em>Divine</em></strong> (spelled DIVINE), was born on <strong><em>October 2, 1990</em></strong>, in Mumbai, Maharashtra. He rose to fame with the number-one song <strong><em>"Mere gully mein</em></strong>," in which he sang about the tasks that residents of Mumbai's chawls and slums had to perform daily. He has a distinctive flow that works well in mainstream <em>Kaam 25</em> and literary medleys like Junoon. He started to gain popularity after one of his songs, <strong><em>"Yeh Mera Bombay,"</em></strong> was published (2013). On December 12, 2020, Divine made history by being the first Indian rapper to be featured on the <em>Spotify Times Square billboard</em> in New York City thanks to his soundtrack <strong><em>Punya Paap (2020),</em></strong> which had earlier topped Apple Music India's rankings. He was the first hip-hop artist from India to make his Grammy debut at the <strong><em>64th Grammy Awards</em></strong> in 2022. He is well known for encapsulating the street culture of Mumbai. Divine announced the founding of a new company, Gully Gang Entertainment, in February 2019 to discover and nurture hip-hop talent in the Mumbai area. The record company "<strong>Gully Gang Records</strong>" is also involved in this attempt.</p>
<h2 class="h2">4. MC Stan</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-rappers-in-india4.png" alt="Top 10 Rappers In India" />
<p><em>He w</em>as born on <strong><em>August 30, 1999</em></strong>. MC Stan's dissing rap battle with Emiway Bantai and the song "<strong><em>Wata,"</em></strong> which has gathered over 9 million views on YouTube, originally made him famous. His YouTube account has more than 5 Million subscribers.</p>
<p>His flow and manner of rapping make him similar to Tupac, even though he is not Tupac. For this reason, we might refer to him as the <strong><em>Indian Tupac</em></strong>. The woman MC Stan is in a relationship with and resides in Pune, Maharashtra, is named <strong><em>Niya. Altaf Tadavi,</em></strong> often known as MC Stan, is one of the most gifted young rappers in India. MC Stan's style of rapping is unique compared to the other rappers on the list.
