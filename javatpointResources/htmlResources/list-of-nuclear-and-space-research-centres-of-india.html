<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/gk/images/list-of-nuclear-and-space-research-centres-of-india1.jpg" class="imageright" alt="List of Nuclear and Space Research Centres of India" />
<p>It is a prestigious nuclear research centre of India situated at the Trombay in the Mumbai city of the Maharashtra state of India. Formerly, it was known as the Atomic Energy Establishment Trombay; later, it was renamed BARC in 1967 after the demise of Dr. Bhabha in 1966 due to an air crash. Dr. Ajit Kumar Mohanty is the director of BARC, 12 March 2019 onwards.</p>
<p><a href="barc-full-form.html">BARC</a> aims to search and explore peaceful applications of nuclear energy, specifically in the areas of power generation and utilization. Besides this, it also works on the processing of used nuclear fuel and monitors the functioning of nuclear reactors present in the country.</p>
<p>It maintains eight research reactors, which are Apsara, Cirus, Dhruva, Zerline, Purnima I, II, and III. It also designs and develops reactors, including the heavy water reactors and fast breeder reactors, and is engaged in the production of radioisotope, and setting up manufacturing units for uranium and nuclear fuels, waste immobilization, isotope laboratories, and more. Furthermore, it has established pilot plants for producing zirconium, heavy water, titanium, heavy water. Besides this, it is also actively engaged in weapons-related projects.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="ISRO" class="h2">2) Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO):</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/gk/images/list-of-nuclear-and-space-research-centres-of-india2.jpg" class="imageright" alt="List of Nuclear and Space Research Centres of India" />
<p>It is an Indian space agency that is famous all over the world for its achievements in the field of space search and exploration. It was established in 1969 after superseding the former Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR). It was Dr. Vikram Sarabhai who understood the importance of space technology in the nation's development and guided the ISRO in performing its duties for the development. Accordingly, <a href="isro-full-form.html">ISRO</a> started working with the aim of providing space-based services and develop the infrastructure, equipment, and technologies to achieve the same indigenously.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is maintaining a large fleet of communication satellites, the Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) for fast and reliable communication, and Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites for earth observation. So, it has developed various satellites for specific applications for the country, such as communication, weather forecasts, telemedicine, geographic information system, and more. As of 2015, A S Kiran Kumar is the Chairman of ISRO. ISRO has achieved a lot in the space-based services. Today, it is the leading space agencies in the world.</p>
<p>ISRO's Vision: To pursue planetary exploration and space science research and use space technology for the development of the nation.</p>
<h3 class="h4">Mission:</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>To provide access to space by developing launch vehicles and allied technologies</li>
<li>To carry out earth observation, navigation, communication, meteorology, and space science through satellites and related technologies</li>
<li>To undertake the Indian National Satellite programs for fulfilling television broadcasting, telecommunication requirements</li>
<li>To launch Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) programs for managing the natural resources and environmental monitoring through space-based imagery</li>
<li>Societal development for space-based applications</li>
<li>R&amp;D projects in planetary exploration and space science</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="AEC" class="h2">3) Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) of India:</h2>
<p>The Atomic Energy Commission of India was established by the Department of Scientific Research in August 1948. It acts as a leading entity of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) with its headquarters in Mumbai. Homi J. Bhabha was the first chairman of AEC, and as of 2019, K.N. Vyas was the chairman of AEC.</p>
<p>The main objectives behind establishing the AEC are as follows:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>To provide training to the atomic scientists of the country</li>
<li>To organize and promote research in the field of atomic science in the country</li>
<li>To support and promote nuclear research in laboratories of commission in India</li>
<li>To carry out the exploration and extraction of atomic minerals in India and to use them on an industrial scale.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="ECIL" class="h2">4) Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL):</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/gk/images/list-of-nuclear-and-space-research-centres-of-india4.jpg" class="imageright" alt="List of Nuclear and Space Research Centres of India" />
<p>ECIL was established in April 1967 by A.S. Rao to pave a strong foundation in the field of electronics. It is a Govt. of India entity under the aegis of 'department of atomic energy (DAE)' and is headquartered in Hyderabad. Retd. Admiral Sanjay Chaubey is the chairman and managing director of the ECIL, as of July 2018.</p>
<h3 class="h4">Vision:</h3>
<p>To make the country independent in strategic electronics</p>
<h3 class="h4">Mission:</h3>
<p>To become a trusted and vital national asset in strategic electronics while emphasizing Atomic Energy, Defence, and vital areas of national interests.</p>
<p>ECI aims to serve the country in the field of peaceful uses Atomic Energy. It is a multidisciplinary organization that emphasizes home-grown nuclear energy, space science, and defence system.</p>
<p>It also works in partnership with various renowned nuclear energy enterprises in India, such as Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC), and more. </p>
<p>Besides this, it also actively supports and promotes other vital sectors like Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), Defence Indian Ordnance Factories, Department of Space, Civil Aviation, Oil and Gas, Agriculture, etc. It has also produced the first home-grown digital computers in India TDC 312, TDC 316 and solid-state TV, the first earth station antenna of India, and control and instrumentation for nuclear power plant, and more.</p>
