<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-hollywood-directors8.png" class="imageright" alt="Top 10 Hollywood Directors" />
<p>Guy Stuart Ritchie is an English filmmaker who works in various capacities within the film industry. British mobster flicks and the Sherlock Holmes movies with Robert Downey Jr.</p>
<p>At the age of 15, Ritchie dropped out of school and began working in the film business, eventually becoming a director of television commercials. His feature directing debut, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), came after directing The Hard Case's short film in 1995. Snatch (2000), his second feature, was critically and commercially acclaimed. Snatch was Ritchie's second directorial effort; his third, Swept Away (2002), was a critical and commercial failure. It starred Madonna, whom he was married later. His next two films, Revolver (2005) and RocknRolla (2008), were less well-received and met with a more divided reception. Sherlock Holmes and its sequel, were two of his most popular films in 2009 and 2011.</p>
<p>His films include The Man from UNCLE, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, and Aladdin: Live-Action Adaptation of Disney's Animated Movie (2019). When it went through the theatrical run, Aladdin raked in around $1 billion worldwide, becoming one of the top-earning pictures of the year, it became 34th highest-grossing film of all time. "The Gentlemen" (2019) was generally highly reviewed and an economic triumph for him in 2020. Wrath of Man, starring Jason Statham, was directed by him in 2021.</p>
<h2 class="h2">9. David Fincher</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-hollywood-directors9.jpg" class="imageright" alt="Top 10 Hollywood Directors" />
<p>He is an American film director, David Fincher (born August 28, 1962). Oscar nominations for his films, often psychological thrillers and biographical dramas, including three for Best Director.</p>
<p>Fincher's passion for filmmaking began at a young age when he was born in Denver, Colorado. The MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction went to him for both 1989's "Express Yourself" and 1990's "Vogue," two of Madonna's best-known music videos. After starring in the critically panned Alien 3 (1992), he starred in the critically acclaimed thriller Seven (1995). Although Fight Club became a cult classic, Fincher had a mixed reception with Fight Club (1999) and The Game (1997). Panic Room, starring Jodie Foster in 2002, brought him back to popularity.</p>
<p>Aside from Mank and The Social Network, Fincher was involved in the direction of Zodiac (2007), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), and The Social Network (2009). As a result of his efforts on The Social Network, he was honoured with the Golden Globe and BAFTA Awards for Best Director. Benjamin Button (2008, with 13 Oscar nominations) and Gone Girl (2014, with 11 British Academy Film Awards nominations) are his two greatest financial triumphs, earning over $300 million worldwide.</p>
<p>For Netflix's House of Cards (201318) and Mindhunter (201719), he was an executive producer and director, and he won an Emmy for his work on the premiere episode of House of Cards. Production business Propaganda Films was co-founded by David Fincher.</p>

<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/top10-technologies/images/top-10-hollywood-directors10.png" class="imageright" alt="Top 10 Hollywood Directors" />
<p>An American entrepreneur, filmmaker, and producer, G. Walton Jr. is best known for creating of most popular movies. He was chairman before Lucasfilm was sold to Disney in 2012.</p>
<p>Lucas along with Francis Ford Coppola after their graduation from USC in 1967, co-founded American Zoetrope. His student film Electronic Labyrinth was a critical and financial success, but his feature film debut, THX 1138, was not. American Graffiti (1973), which covered his youth in Modesto, California, was his next work as a writer-director, produced by Lucasfilm. Critics and audiences lauded the film, nominated for five Oscars.</p>
<p>Another film produced by Walton, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), became a surprise hit despite it had production issues, it grossed over $1 billion and winning six Oscars. After The Empire Strikes Back (1980), he co-wrote Return of the Jedi (1983). (1983). Steven Spielberg recommended composer John Williams, with whom Lucas has worked on these franchises. From the 1970s to the 2010s, he produced and wrote for Lucasfilm.</p>
<p>Lucas is a four-time Academy Award nominee and one of the most financially successful filmmakers. His films are among the top 100 highest-grossing films in North America based on ticket inflation. Lucas is a key figure in the 20th century New Hollywood movement and a modern blockbuster pioneer.</p>
