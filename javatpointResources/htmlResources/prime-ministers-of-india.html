<p>She was popularly known as '<strong><em>the Iron Lady of India</em></strong>' due to her leadership qualities, decision-making abilities, and uncompromising politics.</p>
<p>She supported the independence movement in East Pakistan and allowed war with Pakistan that resulted in the creation of Bangladesh after India defeated Pakistan.

<p>During her <strong><em>final term</em></strong> as a prime minister, she ordered a military action named <strong>'<em>Operation Blue Star'</em></strong> in the Sikh community's sacred place Golden Temple that was taken over by Sikh extremists. It caused an uprising within the Sikh community and as a result of this, she was assassinated on <strong><em>31 October 1984</em></strong> outside her home by her trusted bodyguards.
