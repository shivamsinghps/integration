<h1 class="h1">Advantages and Disadvantages of Contact Lenses</h1>
<p>The eye's lens is a tiny, translucent, thin, bowl-shaped object that is attached to the inside surface of the eye. Eye lenses are often brightly colored to facilitate handling for the wearer. There are two categories of contact lenses available today: hard and soft. Most people only wear soft lenses. Contact lenses have a long and illustrious history, despite the fact that they may appear to be a more recent development in eye care. Contact lenses were first proposed by eminent thinkers René Descartes and Leonardo da Vinci. The first wearable, transparent contact lens, was developed by a German glazier in the 19th century. The first contact lens that could be used as a lens was developed by a German eye doctor. The lenses were Wearable for several hours at the bar.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/blog/images/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-contact-lenses.png" alt="Advantages and Disadvantages of Contact Lenses" />
<p>Wearing contact lenses for vision correction has now become fairly widespread, but some people also wear lenses purely for aesthetic and novelty reasons. Costume contact lenses can even help generate some of the amazing effects you see on the big screen at the movies. Colored contact lenses entirely alter the colour of your eyes.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Contact lens types</h2>
<p>Contact lenses can be divided into the following three parts:</p>
<h3 class="h3">1. Soft contact lenses</h3>
<p>The most popular type of contact lenses is soft ones for a number of reasons. They are more flexible, comfortable, and appropriate for long-term usage because they are constructed using cutting-edge optical technology. They are available to anyone who wants to wear lenses thanks to their user-friendly design.</p>
<p><strong>There are many different types of these lenses-</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Daily disposable</strong>- Daily disposables are only used once before being discarded.</li>
<li><strong>Two-Week Disposable</strong>: These lenses can be used for two weeks before being discarded.</li>
<li><strong>Monthly disposable lenses-</strong> Monthly disposable lenses must be changed after being worn for a month.</li>
<li><strong>Extended Wear-</strong> These hydrogel lenses for extended wear represent the most recent development in lens technology. Due to their low oxygen intake to the eyes, these lenses are more pleasant and may be worn for longer periods of time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">2. Gas permeable contact lens</h3>
<p>These are also referred to as GP lenses or hard lenses. Despite not having any water, these lenses are nonetheless cosy. These lenses have been widely utilized for a long time; even if it has since decreased, they are still used for various issues. These can be worn for longer periods of time and are more durable than soft lenses. They must generally be changed every six months or a year because they are worn every day.</p>
<h3 class="h3">3. Colored contact lenses</h3>
<p>Soft-coloured lenses can be changed every day or every month. Your eyes' hue is altered by it. Even those who do not require lenses at all wear these lenses. Purchase a 0. 00 number of simple lenses if all you intend to utilize your lenses for fashion.</p>
<h2 class="h2">How to wear contact lenses</h2>
<p><strong>The stages of wearing contact lenses are as follows:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Use soap to wash your hands, then a fresh towel to dry them.</li>
<li>Wash the lenses in the solution to get rid of the dirt. If the lenses are brand-new, you may just skip this step.</li>
<li>To prevent lens mixing, always put the right eye's lenses in first.</li>
<li>Place your index finger over the lens at this point.</li>
<li>Verify that the lens is not inverted.</li>
<li>Your other hand should support your eyelids so that your eye stays open.</li>
<li>With your lens hand's free finger, gently pull the lower eyelid down.</li>
<li>With your index finger, position the lens beneath your eye's pupil while looking up.</li>
<li>Now, slowly take your hand off the eyelids and briefly close your eyes.</li>
<li>Normal eye blinking will cause the lens to pass over the pupil.</li>
<li>Remove the lenses and inspect them for debris or damage if wearing them is bothersome. Clean them using a solution if they are soiled, and discard them if they are damaged.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2">Steps to remove contact lenses</h2>
<ul class="points">
<li>Use soap to wash your hands, then a fresh towel to dry them.</li>
<li>With your index finger, touch the lower surface of the lens and insert it into the white portion of your eye below the pupil while looking up.</li>
<li>If you're holding the lens between your thumb and forefinger, kindly remove it. To remove the second lens, follow the same procedure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2">Uses of contact lenses</h2>
<ul class="points">
<li>People who use glasses but dislike wearing them can utilize contact lenses in place of their spectacles.</li>
<li><strong>Color lenses</strong>: Some wear them for aesthetic reasons, to appear good or to stand out at a party or other event.</li>
<li>Actors in movies wear contact lenses when necessary for the scene.</li>
<li>BCL (Bandage Contact Lens) uses a contact lens to prevent pricking when there is a large wound on the pupil, stitches on the pupil for whatever cause, or swelling on the pupil following surgery. For this, contact lenses are utilized.</li>
<li>Keratoconus is a condition that causes the pupil to resemble a cone; in this case, special contact lenses are used to stop the cone from growing.</li>
<li>Some contacts are worn overnight; after that, the size of the pupil changes, the quantity drops, and the amount of glasses can be gradually reduced.</li>
<li>White thin contact lenses eye can be used to mask the whiteness if the pupil of someone's eye has gone white due to trauma or injury, making both eyes appear the same.</li>
<li>There is a technique using PRK procedures that totally remove the need for glasses, followed by the use of contact lenses for two to three days.</li>
<li>If an infection has caused a hole in the pupil, it is sealed with medical adhesive and a contact lens is placed on top.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2">Precautions to be taken during contact lens use</h2>
<ul class="points">
<li>If you wear contact lenses every day, you should take them out before bedtime to avoid developing an eye infection.</li>
<li>The contact lens solution should be adequately cleansed as directed by the eye doctor both before and after the contact lens is placed in the eyes. Otherwise, the infection may develop.</li>
<li>Excessive rubbing while cleaning the contact lens might also harm it. It might blow up.</li>
<li>Never leave soft lenses dry, that is, without soaking them in contact lens solution, as this increases the risk of the lens rotting.</li>
<li>Never clean or store contact lenses in water. Use contact lens solution at all times.</li>
<li>The lens case should be discarded every three months and cleaned each day properly while it is in use.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2">How and what are contact lenses made of?</h2>
<p>There are two main types of lenses: <strong>soft lenses</strong> and <strong>rigid gas-permeable lenses.</strong></p>
<h3 class="h3">1. Soft lenses</h3>
<p>A soft substance is injected into a mould to create soft lenses. After cooling, the substance will assume a mould-like shape by removing any extra material.</p>
<p>A form of a polymer called hydrogel has a high capacity for water absorption. They are, therefore, suitable for soft contact lenses, which are constructed of a single layer of hydrogel. One drawback is that because hydrogels are so absorbent, they might give the appearance of larger contact lenses. Use less water if you want thinner, more comfortable contact lenses. Silicone hydrogel is used to make some modern soft lenses. Since these materials are more permeable to oxygen than normal lenses, they are more comfortable to wear. Many owners of these claims found to be really satisfied with them.</p>
<h3 class="h3">2. Rigid gas-permeable lenses</h3>
<p>A gas is injected into a mould to create rigid gas-permeable lenses. The gas will permeate the substance and shape the lens as it does so. Before the lens can be polished, the extra material may occasionally need to be removed.</p>
<p>It is created by precisely shaping a piece of stiff gas-permeable lens material using a special cutting tool and then polishing the result to create a precision-cut lens. For more complicated lens prescriptions, like as progressive lenses, this method is employed. Due to the high porosity of rigid contact lenses, a lot of oxygen can quickly reach your eyes. Without water in your lenses, you may see more clearly as a result. In order to increase the oxygen permeability of lenses and prolong their wear time, fluorine is added to them. You'll be able to see clearly once your eyes have adjusted.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Advantages of wearing contact lens</h2>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Full View</strong> - Contact lenses provide a wider field of vision than glasses, so we are not forced to compromise our left and right side views in order to use glasses. 360-degree full vision results from the contact lens covering the entire pupil.</li>
<li><strong>Injury avoidance</strong>- Players who wear glasses while playing run the risk of getting hurt; however, this is not the case with contact lenses.</li>
<li><strong>Helpful even in fog</strong>- While wearing glasses in the rain or fog can be challenging, contactlenses pose no such issues.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate the issues with glasses</strong>- Contact lenses don't weigh on the nose and ears the way glasses do.</li>
<li><strong>Effective even in the sun</strong> - You cannot wear goggles in the sun if you are wearing several pairs of glasses. Contact lenses may be worn on top of goggles.</li>
<li>The glasses' frames will go with every attire; this is untrue. Such a question is not relevant to contact lenses.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2">Disadvantages of Contact lenses</h2>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Allergy to lens material or solution</strong>: See an eye doctor right away if you experience any allergy symptoms, such as redness, itchiness, or watery eyes. These signs of infection are also possible. In this case, the doctor may prescribe a lens made of a different material or a different lens solution.</li>
<li><strong>Infection risk</strong>: If the cleanliness of the lens and lens case is not adequately maintained, infection risk may develop.</li>
<li><strong>Dry eyes</strong>: This condition can develop after several years of use. The doctor will give you specific drops to use for this.</li>
<li><strong>Scratches on the pupil</strong>: Scratches on the pupil can occur while using lenses that are damaged, too tight, or that have passed their expiration date. Consult your eye doctor right away if you experience any of these symptoms.</li>
