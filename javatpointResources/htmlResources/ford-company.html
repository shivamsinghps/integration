<h1 class="h1">Ford Company</h1>
<p><strong>Ford Motor Company</strong> or most famously known as <strong>Ford</strong> is well renowned American company worldwide. Ford has been working as a vehicle producer and manufacturer for more than 118 years successfully; the firm's main headquarters is in Dearborn, Michigan, the city of the United States. <strong><em>This firm was primarily established by Henry Ford and built on June 16, 1903.</em></strong> Ford not only sells automobiles and commercial vehicles but also sells lavish cars for its popular luxury brand name <strong>Lincoln</strong>. But apart from these luxury cars, Ford also possesses Brazilian SUV producer <strong>Troller</strong>. <em>Also, the firm had its share in other big companies, such as 8% in Aston Martin, which is a brand of the United Kingdom, and 32% shares of the Chinese firm Jiangling Motors.</em></p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/company/images/ford-company.png" alt="Ford Company" />
<p>The firm also has a combined business enterprise with the Chinese firm Changan <em>Ford, Taiwan's firm Ford Lio Ho, Thailand's AutoAlliance Thailand Company, Turkish firm Ford Otosan, and Russian corporation Ford Sollers.</em> The corporation is scheduled on the New York Stock Exchange (one of the biggest stock exchanges in the world) and is working under the supervision of the Ford family; they have marginal possession, but because of the greater part of the voting power, all the controls come under them.</p>
<p>Being one of the oldest firms in the world in the automobile industry the, Ford initiated the main techniques used for the extensive developments of cars and also how to manage the large-scale administration of handling employees with the help of highly developed and modern techniques which were characterized by affecting assembly lines and until 1914, these techniques were recognized as the Fordism in all around the globe.</p>
<p><em>In the year 2018, the firm was ranked as the eleventh largest American corporation on the Fortune 500 list of the year; this list was based on worldwide revenues of the previous year, 2017, where ford earned $156.7 billion.</em> In the same year, Ford formed 5.532 million vehicles and became the firm with nearly 213,000 workers at approximately 90 plants and services worldwide. The firm's main purpose is to help create enhanced humankind, in which every human being is free to go anywhere they want and chase their dreams for themselves. Even the present chairman of the firm, Bill Ford said that <em>"A good firm conveys outstanding products and services but a great one brings outstanding products and services and strives to build the world an enhanced place</em>."</p>

</ul>
<h2 class="h2">Establishment and Early Days of the Company</h2>
<p>When we talk about the establishment of the firm, the founder Mr. Henry Ford kept his first step in the industry through his first firm <strong>Henry Ford Company</strong> which was <strong>started in November 1901.</strong> But the firm was renamed <strong>Cadillac Motor Company</strong> in 1902 when Henry decided to leave all the rights regarding his name. But the next year, he again launched a big factory with the help of twelve investors (who gave him an amount of $28,000 (a big amount for those days). He named his firm the Ford Motor Company, and the firm's two main investors, John and Horace Dodge, also later launched their firms of cars. One interesting fact about the firm was its founder Mr. Henry was a young man (39 years old while founding the firm), and even after him, the firm is still in control of his Ford family.</p>
<p>After establishing the firm, Ford decided to not become its first President and he gave this honor to a local banker Mr. John S. Gray, so that all the investors can be ensured that Mr. Henry will not leave his new firm in the same way as he did earlier. The firm, in its early days, was producing a small number of cars a day at its industrial unit, which was on Mack Avenue and after a few days in another factory was on Piquette Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Only the collection of two or three men at a time was working on every car, it was gathering parts prepared generally by the supplier corporations contracting for Ford. But in the upcoming 10 years, the firm mentor the world in the development and modification of the assembly line idea, and within no time, Ford started producing most of these parts by itself.</p>
<p>After a year of establishment in 1904, Henry Ford helped in building the first global plant for his firm in Walkerville (now Windsor), Ontario; it was just right of the Detroit River (that means closer to the Firm's other services, to keep an eye on every service). As the corporation was a completely separate business with a huge number of shareholders and investors, the firm was not only targeting entire Canada to sell vehicles but also wanted to be part of every country's market with its products. In the year 1907, Childe Harold Wills was chosen to create the logo of the firm, and with the help of his grandfather's outline set, he created a logo in the writing styles which were taught in the schools during their (Will and Henry's) childhood. Yet, there was no Ford oval on any car till then the 1927 Model A came out. From 1903 to 1908, the firm launched many car models such as A, B, C, F, K, N, R, and S, and more than hundreds or even a few thousand cars were sold every year, and Ford was already in profit till now.</p>
<p><em>But in the year 1908, Ford launched its first out-of-the-country sales division in the beautiful city of Paris in France and also introduced its latest model T, to the world in the same year.</em> This amazing model of Henry was so simple yet classic, easily affordable by an upper-middle-class man, and was the sturdy automobile, so this model gave wheels to the entire world until the model was stopped established by the firm in 1927; over 15 million cars were already sold which proves it one of the best invention of the era and one of the greatest cars in the whole world till now. But this was not the only reason behind the car; in 1908, there were merely about 18,000 miles of cemented roads in the US. And this model was designed with the light and strong vanadium steel alloy as vital elements of the car so that it could deal with the age-old roads ( rough roads). Also, at the same time, the majority of the automobiles were so costly that only the richest people could buy them, and others were using public transport and trains to travel from one place to another. But the firm was not satisfied with the small number of buyers. Hence, they decided to create another better and more affordable transport option, and luckily for millions of fresh drivers, it was what helped them get what they wanted.</p>
<p>And Ford was also creating these boats to support the Navy throughout World War I, and at the time, Ford was producing a vast number and set a record of a boat in merely ten days. This was not only a way to get profit but Henry Ford's noble attempt to support the country and construct simply a product by affecting their manufacturing principles to a fresh product. This idea of using such production was already applied by the firm in the past and was completed successfully.</p>
<p>In the year 1913, Ford's launched another updated version of Model T to reduce the price of the primary Model T. And this updated version was finally concentrated on the Model T's framework assembly line from 12.5 to almost 1.5 hours. In doing so, they created a revolution in the industries of car manufacturers. The speed of accelerator with which Ford could create cars helped him carry on lowering the cost of the Model T so this was a good way to support the firm.</p>
<p>In the year 1914, $5 per day was introduced by Henry Ford, which was twice the obtainable pay speed for factory personnel, and at its peak of that, Ford fixed the workday from nine to eight hours a day. The day after the "$5 per day" was announced by the Ford, a predictable 10,000 people lined up outside Ford's hiring office eager to be hired. Ford's amplified pay greatly enhanced employee maintenance since the repetitive and tiring work of the stirring assembly line was the basis of lofty turnover.</p>
<p>The improved wage permitted many of Ford's employees to buy the cars they created, and the eight-hour workday permitted Ford to run 3 shifts a day in the place of 2. The increased pay, enlarged free time, and even enlarged the individual mobility of car ownership and even enlarged the individual mobility of car ownership were all important features in forming an American middle-class person.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Ford's History from 1917 to 2021</h2>
<p>Ford kept upgrading every year, so here are some key points about the changes that happened during these years, </p>
<ul class="points">
