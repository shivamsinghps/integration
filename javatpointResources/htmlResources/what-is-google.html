<h1 class="h1">What is Google?</h1>

<h2 class="h2">A brief history of Google</h2>
<p>In <strong>1995,</strong> Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both computer science students at Stanford University, started working on a search engine called BackRub. It was a computer program that leveraged record data and backlink analysis to track on the internet. The name of a search engine, BackRub, was inspired by the algorithms ranking. An algorithm that calculated how many back-links are included in a web page.</p>
<p>During that time, the result of the BackRub program depended on how frequently words appeared on a web page, which allowed web designers to use the same keywords, again and again, to improve their ranking in search results. A data collection system, the crown jewel of BackRub, was known as <strong>"PageRank"</strong> that was used to improve the rank of websites with the help of counting the number of pages and based on their relevance to keywords. Consequently, the rank of the higher-quality websites reached to top. This technology became the reason to create Google; even it led to the cresting of Google directly. When Bryn and Page were working out of their Stanford dormitory rooms, they self-funded it.</p>
<p>Before the co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Andy Bechtolsheim, Bryn and Page used discounted computer parts and mostly their credit cards. For $100,000, they wrote a check out to "Google Inc. to run the company by 1998, in the same year, 4 September 1998, Google was formally incorporated. On a Stanford professor's front porch, Bechtolsheim saw an early Google product demo and then reportedly wrote the check.</p>
<p>The name of the Google is chosen by Larry and Sergey, which is inspired from the word "googol." In the book of the Imagination and Mathematics, the name is formally included. Both Google founders viewed its name as a great way in term of collecting information on everything on the internet and began to encapsulate the difficult task.</p>
<p>With the time, Google released AdWords in 2002 and got popularity. AdWords was an Advertising platform for advertisers. Page and Bryn contacted the technology company for $3 billion in funding that led to creating a chance once again for Yahoo to cash in on Google. Google found the money elsewhere as Yahoo declined for funding. And, over the past 16 years, the Advertising tool (AdWords) has become a huge profit center for Google.</p>
<p>The technology was grown rapidly; Soon after, Google started the various additional key company. Google AdSense was developed in 2003, a product that allows publishers to make money by running ads and monetizing their content from Google AdWords. Later on, on April Fool's Day in 2004, Gmail, Google's email product, was released.</p>

<li><strong>Google H4x0r:</strong> Another well-known hidden Easter egg that displays Google's search page and results in leetspeak. For example, click on the link- <a href="https://www.google.com/?hl=xx-hacker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/?hl=xx-hacker</a> to redirect to Google's search page in leetspeak.</li>
