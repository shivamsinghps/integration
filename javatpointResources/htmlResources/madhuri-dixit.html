Madhuri Dixit, one of the most beautiful actresses across Indian cinema and television, has worked in more than 70 Bollywood movies. Before working in the movies and cinemas, the career of Madhuri Dixit revolved around family and romantic drama. After her career expanded from television dramas to Bollywood films, she got so much popular for her dancing skills, acting skills, and her beauty. It is even said that she is one of the most beautiful actresses that Indian cinema has ever got.</p>
<h2 class="h2">A Brief About</h2>
<p><em>Madhuri Dixit was born on 15 May 1967 (54 years old now) in a Marathi Kokanastha Brahmin local family of Maharashtra. Madhuri Dixit was born and brought up in Mumbai (Bombay then), Maharashtra, and she was raised with her parents.</em> Madhuri Dixit was 17 years old when she got her first break into the television. She made her debut on television in 1984 by getting the lead role in the 'Abodh' (a popular Indian drama at that time). Before getting a popular hit movie, Madhuri Dixit has faced a few successive commercially failed films, which played an important role in shaping her career. She got her major breakthrough into Indian cinema in the year 1988, with the Tezaab movie (an action-drama-based Hindi movie).</p>
<p><em>This helped her in establishing herself as the leading actress in the top-grossing romantic drama movies of that time, such as Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994), Beta (1992), Dil (1990), and many others.</em> She also worked on many other popular films of that period, including Raja (1995), Khalnayak (1993), Saajan (1991), Kishen Kanhaiya (1990), Thanedaar (1990), Tridev (1989), Ram Lakhan (1989), and many others, which were commercially successful in the box office too.

<p>Apart from the romantic drama films, <em>Madhuri Dixit has also received praise from critics and her fans for her work in many crime-based Bollywood movies, such as Prem Pratigya (1989), Parinda (1989), and Devdas (2002),</em> and she had even received the Filmfare award for the last one. For the Devdas movie, Madhuri Dixit received the Filmfare award in the category of Best supporting actress in the crime drama movie. She has also been a part of many Bollywood thriller movies<em>, including Pukaar (2004) &amp; Anjaam (1998), and many social dramas, such as Lajja (2001), Mrityudand (1997), and many others.</em></p>

She also worked as the leading actress in many other types of comedy movies, like the Marathi comedy-drama Bucket List (2018) and the black comedy Dedh Ishqiya (2014), and even gained an appreciation for her role in these movies.

She has also worked as the leading actress in the dancing &amp; musical-oriented movie Aaja Nakhleh (2007), for which she has gained so much popularity and praise from her critics and many other Bollywood actors &amp; actresses.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Background and Early Life</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/biography/images/madhuri-dixit3.png" class="imageright" alt="Madhuri Dixit" />
<p>On 15 May 1967, Madhuri Dixit (now Madhuri Dixit Nene) was born in Bombay (now Mumbai) into a traditional Marathi Kokanastha Brahmin local family of Maharashtra. Madhuri Dixit is the youngest child of Shankar and Snehlata Dixit, her father &amp; mother, respectively, and she has three elder siblings (including two elder sisters and one elder brother). She had a keen interest in dance from a very early age, and when she was three, she went on to train in Kathak for eight straight years. Later, Madhuri Dixit herself became a professionally trained and popular Kathak dancer.</p>
<p><em>She even recalls that she received her first scholarship as a kathak dancer when she was nine. She also remembers that only because of her dance performance, her name appeared in a Newspaper for the first time.</em> Talking about this experience, she describes that she was seven or eight when she was performing at the Guru Purnima festival, and there was a journalist who later wrote an article stating that "This little girl stole the show." This gave her a sense of achievement and boosted her confidence towards her keen interest in the dance.</p>
<p><em>The primary or schooling education of Madhuri Dixit was completed in Divine Child High School, present in Andheri, Mumbai. During her primary education, she had participated in many extra-curricular activities such as drama, dancing, and many others, apart from her studies.</em> Willing to become a microbiologist, she enrolled in the Sathaye college (present in the Vile Parle, Mumbai) for her higher education in the field of microbiology. She enrolled in the BSc course in the college, where she opted for microbiology as one of her major subjects in the domain. But only after the 6 months of course completion she decided to withdraw her name from the college and discontinued her higher studies to pursue a full-time career in films.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Acting Career and Achievements</h2>
<p>Talking about the acting career of Madhuri Dixit, it is so much wider that it cannot be studied in one go. Therefore, this article breaks her journey for making acting her career into four parts and emphasizes how each part played a significant role in shaping her acting career. <strong>The acting career of Madhuri Dixit can be broadly divided into four major parts as given below:</strong></p>
<ol class="points">
<li><strong>1980s:</strong> Breakthrough, Early role, &amp; Recognition</li>
<li><strong>1990s:</strong> Major success &amp; widespread prominence</li>
<li><strong>2000s:</strong> Sabbaticals and Further Claim</li>
<li><strong>2010s:</strong> Sporadic work and comebacks</li>
</ol>
<p>These stages of her career describe how her career has shaped from decade to decade and what challenges &amp; achievements during each part of her career. Studying about her career in the categorized way will not only make it easier to study but also make it simpler to analyze the changes &amp; challenges during each phase of her career. <strong>The complete description of each phase of Madhuri Dixit's acting career with major challenges &amp; achievements is described below:</strong></p>
<h3 class="h3">(1) 1980s: Breakthrough, Early role, &amp; Recognition:</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/biography/images/madhuri-dixit4.png" class="imageright" alt="Madhuri Dixit" />
<p><em>With the drama 'Abodh' of the Rajshri production, Madhuri Dixit made her debut in the Indian cinema in the year 1984 when she was only 17 years old. In this drama, she played the role of lead actress opposite the Bengali actor Tapas Paul (the lead actor of the drama).</em> Although the film was a flop commercially as soon as it was released, Madhuri Dixit earned many positive reviews and praiseworthy comments from the movie critics, who praised her for her performance and acting skills in the Abodh. Even Aakash Barvalia of Gomolo, a famous movie critic and well-known journalist of the 80s, also wrote many positive reviews about the performance and acting skills of Madhuri in Abodh, and he also further stated, <em>"Madhuri excels in her role as a young bride who acquits herself well as the naive village girl and does not realize what marriage actually entails."</em></p>
<p>After that, she worked in 'Awara Baap', which was her only release of 1985, and this movie also failed to impressed the audience and failed commercially. Also, during the same time, when her movies were not doing well at the box office, she appeared as the cover girl of Filmfare awards, 1986. In this Filmfare awards of 1986, one of her monochrome photographs of hers which were shot by Gautam Rajadhyaksha, a popular photographer at that time, displayed as the cover photograph of the Filmfare awards. Apart from this, this monochrome photograph of Madhuri Dixit became popular and featured on the cover of Debonair, a popular magazine of that time.</p>
<p><em>The next four releases of Madhuri Dixit, which were Uttar Dakshin (1987), Hifazat (1987), Manav Hatya (1986), &amp; Swati (1986), also failed to impress the audience and did not perform well in the box office.</em> These four releases were not able to capture the cinema audience, failed commercially, and did not even perform critically well. Hifazat was the first movie from the several collaborations of Madhuri Dixit with Anil Kapoor (a famous Bollywood &amp; Indian actor). In the next year (1988), four more films featuring Madhuri Dixit were released and also failed to impress the audience as well as movie critics. In 1988, the four releases featuring her were Mohre, Khatri ke Khiladi, and Davyan, whereas the other was not actually a commercial failure.</p>
<p>The fourth release of her in 1988, Tezaab, actually impressed the audience with her stunning performance and did well at the box office. In Tezaab, Madhuri Dixit played the role of Mohini, who was is forced to dance to make money for her father &amp; was an impoverished and miserable woman. <em>Madhuri Dixit worked opposite Anil Kapoor as the lead actress in N Chandra's action-romance Tezaab and finally attained recognition in Indian cinema. Tezaab also became the highest-grossing movie in the box office for the year 1988,</em> which eventually increased the popularity of Madhuri Dixit to the next level. The huge success of this movie also led to Madhuri Dixit receiving her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination. This huge success of the Tezaab movie marked a significant point in her career and established Dixit as a leading actress in Hindi cinema.</p>
<p>Akshay Shah, a popular journalist from Bollywood Planet, also wrote many positive reviews about Madhuri Dixit for her brilliant performance in the movie. <em>He wrote that even though she got so much popularity for her performance in the item number 'Ek Do Teen', she should be remembered for notable acting in many important scenes of the movie.</em> He further adds that Madhuri Dixit gave a fine-tuned performance, and her acting in the scenes where she is pitted against Anupam Kher was really outstanding and eye-capturing.</p>
<p><em>After getting this huge popularity and success from the box office, Vardi, the first release of Madhuri Dixit in 1989, did really well (comparing to successes of her past movies) in the box office.</em> After Vardi, Madhuri was seen in Subhash Ghai's Ram-Lakhan, where she again worked opposite Anil Kapoor as the leading actress in the movie. In this movie, Madhuri Dixit plays the role of Radha Shastri, a girl who falls in love with her childhood best friend, but they both find it hard to convince her father about their relationship. This movie became a super-hit of Bollywood and finished up as the second-highest-grossing movie in the cinema for 1989.</p>
<p>The next release of Madhuri Dixit was Prem Pratigya, a romance genre movie where she played the role of Laxmi Rao. Laxmi Rao is a distraught woman who influences a local underworld don letting him give up his bad habits, and in this movie, Dixit plays the role of leading actress opposite Mithun Chakraborty. <em>Her performance in this movie was really brilliant, and the success of this movie earned Madhuri Dixit a second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.</em> Many next releases featuring Madhuri Dixit was also a great hit and included as some of the most popular &amp; hit movie in her acting career.</p>
<p>Movies like Tridev, Parinda, and many other releases in the next few years, in which Madhuri Dixit played the lead actress, were one of the highest-grossing movies of the year and commercially successful. <em>One more major successful turnover event came in Madhuri Dixit's life when the film Parinda (featuring Madhuri Dixit as the leading actress) was included in CNN-News18's 2013 list of the "100 greatest Indian films of all time."</em> Apart from this, for the 1990 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Parinda was also selected as the official Indian submission, but later it was not nominated in further rounds.</p>
<h3 class="h3">(2) 1990s: Major success &amp; widespread prominence:</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/biography/images/madhuri-dixit5.png" class="imageright" alt="Madhuri Dixit" />
<p><em>In the year 1990 alone, Madhuri Dixit featured in nine Indian films, and five of them- Jamai Raja, Sailaab, Jeevan Ek Sanghursh, Deewana Mujh Sa Nahi, and Maha-Sangram- were proven as a flop at the box-office and commercially unsuccessful.</em> Her next release in the same year was Rakesh Roshan's action-comedy Kishan Kanhaiya, where she worked as the movie's leading actress. She worked opposite Anil Kapoor, and apart from them, Shilpa Shirodkar also played a crucial role in this movie. This movie depicts the story of twin brothers who were separated at birth, and after the turnaround of events, they re-unite in their youth. This movie proved the major hit, commercially successful, and eventually became the fourth-highest grosser movie of the year. In her next movie, Izzatdar, Madhuri Dixit played the role of a strong-willed woman, and this movie fairly-successful movie at the box office.</p>
<p>After this, she played the role of the leading actress in Dil, in which she worked opposite Aamir Khan. In this movie, Madhuri Dixit played the role of Madhu, who was an arrogant and rich girl, and later fell in the love of a poorer boy, and for this role, she won her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress. This movie also emerged as one of the best hits movies of her career and became the highest-grossing of that year. Even reddif.com, a popular blogging website, and browser, quoted, "<em>She breathed fire as the rebellious lover defying her family,.... she showed her range as a performer"</em> while praising her brilliant performance in the movie. This showed how much outstanding she was in this movie, how successful this movie was at the box office, and how much this movie was liked by the audience as well as movie critics at that time. Her final release of that year was action drama based Thanedaar, in which she played the role of leading actress opposite Anil Kapoor, and this movie was another commercial hit and well-liked by the audience.</p>
<p><em>In the next year (1991), a total of five movies featuring Madhuri Dixit was released, and all of them were average and moderately good at the box office. In the 100 days, one of these five films,</em> Madhuri Dixit played the role of Devi, a clairvoyant woman who has a vision of a murder and sets out to uncover the truth and worked alongside Jackie Shroff, who played the role of the leading actor in the movie. This movie was not a massive success but performed moderately well on the box-office and earned decently.</p>
<p><em>The next release of the year starring Madhuri Dixit was 'Sajan', in which she worked opposite Salman Khan and Dutt. In this movie, Madhuri Dixit played the role of Pooja Saxena, who is in love with her idol - Sagar, and this movie was proved to be a major critical and commercial success.</em> Madhuri Dixit also earned praise and positive reviews from her fans as well as from movie critics for her portrayal of Pooja. Apart from all these praises and positive reviews, the success of this movie also earned her fourth Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for her outstanding work in the film.

This was her first film with Salman Khan, and it emerged as one of the highest-grossing Bollywood movies of all time with a whopping box-office collection of ? 1.35 billion worldwide, which also broke the previous record set by the movie Sholay (1975).</em> The movie had a record for highest-grossing Hindi movie after completing its theatrical run, and this record remained unbroken for 7 years before the release of Gadar in 2001. In this movie, Madhuri Dixit played the role of Nisha, who falls in love with her sister's brother-in-law (Character name Prem) and wants to get married, but their plans face a different type of jeopardy when her sister dies, and both families tie her knot with her brother-in-law (with whom her sister was married).</p>

In this movie, Madhuri Dixit is portrayed as Lalita, who is a dancer running from her abusive lover. <em>Although this movie underperformed at the box office and did not do well commercially, it earned Madhuri Dixit nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.</em></p>

After that, in 1997, Prakash Jha's Mrityudand was released in which Madhuri Dixit played the role of Ketki Singh, who is a village woman, and struggles to confront and defeat the male domination and oppression forces. <em>Madhuri Dixit earned critical acclaim and positive reviews from movie critics for her brilliant acting while portraying Ketki Singh.</em> According to Anupam Chopra, a journalist from India today, <em>"Madhuri Dixit gave the best performance of her career while playing the role of Ketki Singh in Mrityudand. With the simplicity she maintained while portraying Ketki Singh, she was looking stunning and even acting much better."</em> Her portrayal as Ketki Singh was deemed "fiery" by Screen Magazine, and she also won a third Screen Award for Best Actress for her brilliant performance.</p>
<p>Her later releases for the year were Mohabbat, Mahaanta, and Koyla, and except for the last one, none of them were able to impress the audience and did well at the box office. The last film for 1997 featuring Madhuri Dixit (also her fifth film of the year) was Yash Chopra's Dil Toh Pagal Hai, which is a musical romantic drama movie. Apart from her as the lead actress in the movie, Shah Rukh Khan, Karishma Kapoor &amp; Akshay Kumra were also starred in the movie.

This movie was shot over a duration of 350 days and is based on a love story that revolves around the backdrop of the Indian army. Madhuri Dixit played the role of Anjali in this movie, who was a jealous and heartbroken woman (when she was rejected by Anil Kapoor) and swears to take revenge for this rejection from Jai (portrayed by Anil Kapoor).</em></p>
<p>The brilliant portrayal of Anjali by Madhuri Dixit and her excellent acting in the movie brought her many positive reviews from the movie critics and positively welcomed by her fans. She played the role of Anjali so well that she was nominated for the portrayal of best actress in various cinematic award ceremonies, including Screen and Filmfare awards. <em>In the movie review, a movie critic of that time wrote that Madhuri Dixit and Anil Kapoor, both who are veterans in their fields, played their roles brilliantly in the movie &amp; had outdone themselves.</em> This movie became successful and was a blockbuster at the box office, and the success of this movie can be measured with the fact that <em>it fetched 2 National awards that year, including the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration.</em> Her next film, Gaja Gamini, was her first film with the painter cum director MF Hussain (a leading director in Bollywood). Hussain's Gaja Gamini was mediocre at the box office, and in this movie, Madhuri Dixit played the title character (Gaja Gamini).</p>

Madhuri Dixit was praised for her excellent performance in this movie, and her superb and brilliant acting while portraying Janki gained her many positive reviews from the movie critics. This movie was welcomed by all her fans who loved her performance as Janki, and Anil Bora, a movie critic, wrote that <em>Madhuri Dixit was fitted into the role of Janki very easily like she was born for it.</em> Overall, the film proved to be a flop at the Indian box office but proved a success and one of the top grosser overseas.

She played the role of the leading actress in the love triangle Hum Tumhare Hai Sanam, opposite Shah Rukh Khan as well as Salman Khan, and this movie was the only instance where Madhuri Dixit worked with both these veteran actors together. This movie was shot over a duration of six years because of many sabbaticals in between the shooting of this movie, including the production and casting problems. Madhuri Dixit played the role of Radha in this movie, who was a married woman, and her married life was blemished because of her jealousy with her best friend's life. This movie was neither a blockbuster nor a flop at the box office, but it was able to fetch some important positive reviews, and Madhuri Dixit was also praised for her performance in the movie.</p>

She played the role of Chandramukhi in the movie, and her performance while playing this role was simply stunning, lending passion, fire, and gentleness with such consummate ease, and she is still remembered for her brilliant performance. <em>This movie was a real success and proved as one of the biggest blockbusters at the box office with a lifetime earning of ?530 million (US$7.0 million), which proves how commercially successful this movie was.</em> <em>The success of this movie can be measured by the fact that it was featured by Time in their listing of the "10 best films of the millennium" and was screened at the 2002 Cannes Film</em> Festival.</p>
<p>For her superb acting and brilliant performance as Chandramukhi in the movie, she eventually won the Screen Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.
