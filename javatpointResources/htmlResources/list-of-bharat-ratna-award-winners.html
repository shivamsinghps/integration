<p>Before seeing the list of such people who have got Bharat Ratna, let us first know about Bharat Ratna. The Bharat Ratna is India's highest civilian award, and it is given to those who have done something great in their field. The President of India gives this award.</p>
<p>Bharat Ratna is a medal, and if we talk about its decoration, it is in the form of a peepal leaf. The length of this medal is 5.8 cm, the width is 4.7 cm, and its thickness is 3.1 mm. On the upper side of the medal, there is a circular artwork of the Sun, and Bharat Ratna is written in Hindi below it. On the reverse side of the medal, State Emblem is made, and Satyamev Jayate is written in Hindi, and this medal is worn by putting it in white lace.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Bharat Ratna Is Given to Whom?</h2>
<p>We all know what Bharat Ratna is, but to whom is it given? Can Bharat Ratna be given to the people of the whole country? The answer is no; Bharat Ratna is not given to any individual; it is given to only those people who have done great or tremendous work in their field.</p>
<p>But before the year 2011, this award was given only to the people of some limited areas. It was earlier given to the people doing good work in the field of arts, literature, science, and public service. Although, after the year 2011, the government changed the rule and expanded the area, and it is now given to the individuals who have done great work in any field of human endeavor.</p>
