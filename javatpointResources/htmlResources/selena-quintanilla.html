<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/biography/images/selena-quintanilla.jpg" class="imageright" alt="Selena Quintanilla" />
<p><em>Selena Quintanilla P&eacute;rez (April 16, 1971 - September 31, 1995) was an American Tejano artist</em>. <strong><em>Her commitment to music and design acquired her the title "Sovereign of Tejano music,"</em></strong> <em>and she became one of the most empirical Mexican American performers of the late 20th century. Bulletin magazine positioned her third on their rundown of the "Best Latino Specialists Ever" in 2020, given the Latin collections and Latin tunes outlines. Because of her fashion sense and choices, news sources named her the <strong>"Tejano Madonna."</strong></em></p>
<p>She made her debut in the music field as an individual from the band Selena Los Dinos, which likewise incorporated her elder sibling, A.B. Quintanilla, and Suzette Quintanilla. During the 1980s, she was as often as possible chastised and denied appointments at Texas scenes for performing Tejano music, a male-overwhelmed music class. <strong><em>Her ubiquity developed after she won the Tejano Music Grant for Female Performer of the Year for the 10th time in succession in 1987</em></strong>. Her sibling became her essential music maker and lyricist after she endorsed EMI Latin in 1989 and delivered her self-named debut collection that same year.</p>
<p><strong><em>Selena delivered Entre a Mi Mundo (1992), which scorched through eight months at the highest point of the US Board Local Mexican Collections graph. Due to the collection's business achievement, music pundits named it her "leap forward" recording.</em></strong> "Como la Flor," one of its singles, became one of her most well-known signature tunes. Live! (1993) was the principal recording by a female Tejano craftsman to win Best Mexican/American Collection at the 1994 Grammy Grants. Love Prohibido, her 1994 album, became one of the most mind-blowing-selling Latin album in the US. It was broadly credited with introducing the principal attractive period of Tejano music, as it became one of the most famous Latin music subgenres.</p>
<p><strong><em>Yolanda Saldivar, a companion and previous director of Selena, shot and killed Selena on 31, 1995</em></strong>. Saldivar was captured by police when she endeavored to escape and took steps to commit suicide. However, she was convinced to give up. She was viewed as at fault for homicide and condemned to life in jail with the chance of parole in 30 years. Fourteen days after her death, Texas Lead representative George W. Bramble announced April 16 as Selena Day.</p>
<p><em>Selena's after-death hybrid collection album, Longing for You (1995), arose at the highest point of the Bulletin 200, making her the first Latin craftsman to do as such.</em> Warner Brothers were established in 1997 and produced Selena, a film about her life and vocation, was delivered, and it featured a then-obscure Jennifer Lopez as Selena, catapulting Lopez to notoriety. Selena: The Series, featuring Christian Serratos, was released on Netflix in 2020. Selena has sold roughly 18 million records around the world, making her one of the most outstanding selling female Latin specialists.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Life and Career</h2>
<h3 class="h3">1971 - 1988 Early life and career beginnings</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/biography/images/selena-quintanilla2.jpg" class="imageright" alt="Selena Quintanilla" />
<p><strong><em>Selena Quintanilla was born in Lake Jackson, Texas, on April 16, 1971</em></strong>. She was the youngest child of Cherokee ancestry Marcella Ofelia Quintanilla and Mexican American former musician Abraham Quintanilla Jr. Ron Paul, a future House of Representatives member, was the obstetrician-gynecologist at her birth. Selena grew up as a Jehovah's Witness. Quintanilla Jr. first became mindful of her melodic capacities when she was six years of age. "Her timing, her pitch was awesome, I could see it from the very beginning," he told a magazine in an interview.</p>
<p>Quintanilla Jr. opened his most memorable Tex-Mex eatery, Dad Gayo's, in Lake Jackson in 1980, where Selena and her kin Abraham III (on low register guitar) and Suzette Quintanilla (on drums) would regularly perform. The caf&eacute; had to close the next year because of a downturn brought about by the 1980s oil overabundance. They got comfortable in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Quintanilla Jr. became director and advertiser of the recently shaped band Selena y Los Dinos. They required cash, so they performed at traffic intersections, weddings, quinceaneras, and fairs.</p>
<p>Selena's presentation and itinerary slowed her schooling as her fame as a vocalist developed. Her father removed her from school when she was in eighth grade. Marilyn Greer, Selena's teacher, was critical of her musical career. She took steps to report Quintanilla Jr. To the Texas Leading group of Schooling since she thought the circumstances Selena was exposed to were inappropriate for a young lady her age.</p>
<p>Quintanilla Jr. advised Greer to "mind her own business." At the point when different instructors saw how tired Selena seemed when she showed up at school, they communicated their interests. Selena moved on from the American School of Correspondence in Chicago at seventeen and was acknowledged at Louisiana State College. She enlisted at Pacific Western College, where she studied business organization.</p>
<p>Quintanilla Jr. reestablished an old vehicle, naming it "Enormous Bertha" and involving it as their carrier to visit places. During the initial few long stretches of visiting, the family sang for food and scarcely enough cash to cover gas costs. Selena recorded her most memorable LP, Selena y Los Dinos, for Freddie Records in 1984. Regardless of her craving to record English-language tunes, Selena decided to record Tejano music structures, a male-ruled Spanish-language classification with German impacts of polka, jazz, and bluegrass music promoted by Mexicans living in the US.</p>
<p>Quintanilla Jr. thought Selena should record musical compositions about her ancestors. During the collection's recording meetings, Selena needed to learn Spanish phonetically with the assistance of her dad. To advance the collection, Selena showed up on the Johnny Canales Show, a well-known Spanish-language public broadcast, in 1985, where she stayed for quite a long time. <strong><em>Performer Rudy Trevino was the organizer of the Tejano Music Grants, where Selena won Female Singer of the Year in 1987 and for the following nine years.</em></strong></p>
<p>As a result of the periods of the individuals and the way that Selena was the lead vocalist, the band was often turned somewhere near Texas music scenes. Advertisers often let her dad know that Selena could never find lasting success since she was a lady in a type generally overwhelmed by men. Selena had delivered five additional LPs by 1988, including Alpha (1986), Munequito de Trapo (1987), And the Victor Is (1987), Preciosa (1988), and Dulce Love (1988).</p>
<h3 class="h3">1989-1991: Selena, Ven Conmigo, and relationship with Chris P&eacute;rez</h3>
<p>Jos&eacute; Behar, of late formed EMI Latin Records, was in close competition with the new head of Sony Music Latin. Behar was looking for a new Latin singer and expected to sign Selena to EMI's Statehouse Records, but Sony Music Latin offered Quintanilla Jr. twofold the amount. Behar accepted he had found the "following Gloria Estefan," however his predominant excused him as counter-intuitive on the grounds that he had just been in South Texas for seven days. Quintanilla Jr. picked EMI Latin's deal in light of the chance of a hybrid collection, and he maintained that his kids should be the mark's most memorable signings.</p>
<p>Behar and Stephen Finfer mentioned a hybrid collection for Selena's album before she started recording. She recorded three English-language organizations for EMI's pop division chiefs. Selena was told she needed a more extensive fan base to sell a crossover album. After Charles Koppelman denied the venture involving a combination album, Behar accepted EMI Records, and people, in general, didn't accept that a Mexican American lady could have "hybrid potential."</p>
<p>On October 17, 1989, Selena delivered her self-named debut collection. A large portion of the tunes was recorded at So be it Studios in San Antonio, Texas, aside from "Sukiyaki" and "My Affection," which were recorded At the crack of dawn Studios in Houston. Selena expressed "My Adoration," and she maintained that it should be on the collection. Selena's sibling A.B. turned into her essential record maker and musician for the vast majority of her profession, however he didn't compose the tunes "Sukiyaki," "Contigo Quiero Estar," and "No Te Vayas." "Sukiyaki" was initially kept in Japanese during the 1960s by Kyu Sakamoto; Selena utilized Janice Marie Johnson's interpretation of Spanish of an English adaptation of the melody.</p>
<p><strong><em>Selena topped at seven on the US Bulletin Territorial Mexican Collections outline, denoting Selena's most memorable public music chart debut.</em></strong> The collection performed better compared to different accounts by female Tejano artists at that point. Coca-Cola maintained that Selena should be one of their Texas representatives that very year. The jingle utilized in her initial two ads for the organization was composed by A.B. what's more, Chris P&eacute;rez, the last option of whom had as of late joined Selena y Los Dinos as the band's new guitarist. In spite of having a sweetheart in San Antonio, P&eacute;rez started to have heartfelt affections for Selena.</p>
<p>P&eacute;rez figured it would be best for them both to limit any association with her after an outing down to Mexico with the band, yet he viewed that as inconceivable. He decided to attempt to build a relationship with her. They admitted their affections for one another at a Pizza Hovel eatery and wedded before long. P&eacute;rez and Selena kept their relationship hidden because they feared Quintanilla Jr. would try to end it.</p>
<p>In September 1990, Selena delivered her second studio collection, Ven Conmigo. Three singles from Ven Conmigo were delivered: "Ya Ves," "La Tracalera," and "Baila Esta Cumbia." Selena's best single was the last option, a Tejano cumbia melody. Its prominence filled in Mexico, where a gathering collection named after the single was delivered and was ensured platinum by the Asociaci&oacute;n Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON) for deals of 150,000 units.</p>
<p>Yolanda Saldivar, an enlisted medical caretaker, and fan moved toward Quintanilla Jr. about beginning a devoted group of followers in San Antonio. Saldivar got the idea after seeing one of Selena's concerts. Quintanilla Jr. granted Saldivar's request, believing that the fan club would increase the band's exposure. Saldivar immediately became a dear companion to Selena and her family; she was trusted and turned into the group of followers' acting president in 1991. That same year, Salvadoran vocalist Alvaro Torres composed a two-part harmony with Selena that he needed to record. Enrique Elizondo delivered "Buenos Amigos," which was remembered for Torres' 10th studio collection Nothing Se Compara Contigo (1991).</p>
<p>"Buenos Amigos" arrived at number one on the Announcement Top Latin Tunes graph in the US, giving Selena her most memorable number-one single. The music video for the song earned Selena and Torres two nominations for Billboard Music Awards in 1992. At the 1992 Tejano Music Grants, the tune was additionally designated for Team of the Year. As indicated by Selena's biographer Deborah Par&eacute;dez, the melody permitted her to visit the west and east shorelines of the US. As per Bulletin magazine's John Lannert, "Buenos Amigos" profited from expanded airplay on provincial Mexican and Tejano radio broadcasts that had recently excused Selena's accounts.</p>
<h3 class="h3">1992-1993: Elopement, Entre a Mi Mundo, and Selena Live</h3>
<p>Suzette, Selena's sister, claimed she witnessed Selena and P&eacute;rez flirting with each other and immediately informed their father. Quintanilla Jr. escorted P&eacute;rez off the bus and informed him that his relationship with Selena had ended. In spite of Quintanilla Jr's objection, Selena and P&eacute;rez proceeded with their relationship; Selena's mom Marcella supported their relationship. Subsequent to illuminating them regarding his dissatisfaction, Quintanilla Jr. Selena and P&eacute;rez sincerely together on the transport; he pulled over, and a contention between him and Selena resulted. He alluded to P&eacute;rez as a "malignant growth in my loved ones" and took steps to disband the gathering in the event that their relationship proceeded.</p>
<p>Selena and P&eacute;rez consented to head out in different directions; Quintanilla Jr. terminated P&eacute;rez from the band and kept Selena from going along with him. P&eacute;rez and Selena covertly proceeded with their relationship after his excusal. Selena and P&eacute;rez chose to steal away on April 2, 1992, trusting Quintanilla Jr. could never support their relationship. They had a wedding; she expected her dad would need to acknowledge them, and they would never again need to conceal their affection for one another.</p>
<p>The couple eloped just hours after their marriage, according to the media. Selena's family attempted to locate her; Quintanilla Jr. was upset by the news and distanced himself for a time. Selena and P&eacute;rez have relocated to Corpus Christi. Quintanilla Jr. expressed in interviews that he dreaded P&eacute;rez would be a machista (Spanish for a terrible person) who might compel Selena to leave her profession and music objectives, a move that forestalled Quintanilla Jr. from tolerating P&eacute;rez as a reasonable counterpart for Selena at that point. Quintanilla Jr. later moved toward P&eacute;rez, apologized, acknowledged the marriage, and reemerged the band.</p>
<p>In May 1992, a month after her elopement, Selena gave her third studio album collection, Entre a Mi Mundo. The collection was hailed as her "advancement collection" by pundits. The collection crested at number one on the US Bulletin Local Mexican Collections outline for quite a long time; it was confirmed 10 platina by the RIAA for deals of 600,000 collection identical units, while it sold 385,000 units in Mexico. Entre, a Mi Mundo, was the principal Tejano collection and sold more than 300,000 copies by a female singer.</p>
<p>Selena was booked for a high-profile line press visit in Monterrey, Mexico, with music media types participating in a meet-and-welcome. Tejanos were regarded as "hayseed ponchos" by Mexican citizens at the time. The vocalist's Spanish was not even close to familiar; during the collection's question and answer session in Mexico, EMI Latin chiefs were "scared" about the artist's restricted Spanish. Selena "did her best" during the gathering, as indicated by Patoski, and prevailed upon the Mexican media after papers hailed her as a "group's craftsman." The papers depicted her as a much-needed development from the Mexican telenovela entertainers who were "lighter looking, fair-haired, and green-peered toward."</p>
<p>Selena was reserved for performing at a few shows all through Mexico following her exposure, remembering a presentation at the Celebration Acapulco in May 1993, which procured her essential praise. Her exhibition in Nuevo Leon on September 17, 1993, drew 70,000 individuals, procuring her the title of Mexico's greatest Tejano act.</p>
<p>"Como la Flor," "Qu&eacute; Creas?" "La Carcacha," and "Amame" were the album's four singles. "Como la Flor" turned into Selena's distinctive recording, and it was hailed as a career launcher by music pundits. <em>"Como la Flor" assisted Selena with overwhelming the Latin music outlines and becoming gigantically famous in Mexico, where Mexican Americans were, for the most part, despised by the overall population, and pundits generally welcomed it. <strong>The melody was designated for Tune of the Year at the Tejano Music Grants in 1993.</strong></em> The single crested at number six on the Bulletin Top Latin Tunes graph in the US. Entre, a Mi Mundo, was the subsequent smash hit Mexican territorial collection ever in 1994.</p>
<p>Selena delivered Live! A year after Entre a Mi Mundo, it was recorded on February 7, 1993, during a free show at the Dedication Stadium in Corpus Christi. The collection included recently delivered live tracks as well as three studio accounts: "No Debes Jugar," "La Llamada," and "T Robaste Mi Coraz&oacute;n," a two-part harmony with Tejano performer Emilio Navaira. The melodies "No Debes Jugar" and "La Llamada" are diagrammed in the leading five on the Bulletin Top Latin Tunes outline in the US. <strong><em>At the 36th Grammy Grants, Live! gotten the Grammy Award for Best Mexican/American Collection.</em></strong></p>
<p>The Bulletin Latin Music Grants named Live! Collection of the Year in May 1994. Live! won Collection of the Year at the 1994 Tejano Music Grants, and it was assigned to the Provincial Mexican Collection of the Year at the 1994 Lo Nuestro Grants. The RIAA certified Live! as gold for shipments of 500,000 copies, while it sold 250,000 units in Mexico. Selena made a brief appearance in Dos Mujeres, Un Camino, a Mexican telenovela starring Erik Estrada. In 1995, she agreed to appear in another telenovela produced by Emilio Larrosa. She appeared in two episodes that set series rating records.</p>
