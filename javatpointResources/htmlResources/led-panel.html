<h1 class="h1">LED panel</h1>
<p>LED panel is a combination of two different words <strong>panel</strong> and <strong>LED.</strong> The panel is a <strong>rectangular, curved,</strong> or <strong>flat</strong> component that is placed generally on the <strong>wall, ceiling,</strong> or <strong>door.</strong> LED or Light Emitting Diode is a source of light that releases light when an electric current is passed through it. All together, we can say that an LED panel is a panel that consists of various LEDs inside it. It acts as a decorative component that can be mounted on the walls, ceilings of the home.</p>
<p>LED panels are commonly seen in <strong>restaurants, palaces, homes, hospitals, supermarkets, retail stores, offices, hotel lobbies,</strong> etc. LED panels are designed both for commercial and residential purposes.</p>
<p>The advantages of LEDs, such as less power consumption, low fluctuations, high efficiency, long life, no UV rays production, no inert gas present, and single directional oriented light, make it unique from other light sources. Thus, LEDs have replaced incandescent and fluorescent lights. LEDs are widely used today in bulbs and panels. It is easily available in various colors.</p>
<p>Here, we will discuss <strong>LED lights, uses of LED, selection of LED panel lights, top manufacturers of LED panels, types of LED panels,</strong> and more.</p>
<p>Let's first discuss about LEDs before proceeding further.</p>
<h3 class="h3">What is LED?</h3>
<p>LED is a semiconductor device that emits light in photons when an electric current is passed through its terminals. AS the name implies, it is a diode that conducts current in only one direction. Light is formed when the holes (positive charged) and electrons (negatively charged) combine. The process of producing light occurs in a solid-state semiconductor. Hence, LEDs are also known as solid-state devices.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Uses of LED</h2>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/blog/images/led-panel1.png" alt="LED panel" />
<p>LEDs are used today in every field, ranging from LED bulbs at home to LED panels in restaurants or supermarkets. Let's discuss the common uses of LED.</p>
