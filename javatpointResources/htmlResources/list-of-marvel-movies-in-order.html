<h1 class="h1">List of Marvel Movies in order</h1>

<p>Here, in the above list, we have listed down the name of all movies in chronological order (in the 5<sup>th</sup> column of the table) as per the chronological order or the official timeline (year) in which movie released by Marvel Studio itself. We have followed the chronological order of movies data very accurately and precisely as per the data given by the officials of Marvel Studio; otherwise, it becomes very difficult for us to follow a straight chronological order. This is because the chronological order of all the marvel movies is very complicated, and the timeline of many movies mix up with each other, and it makes it very hard to follow a single chronological order for all the marvel movies.</p>
<h4 class="n">Note: In the above list, we have not mentioned Loki in all movies in the chronological order as you can see that we have left one place empty there. This is because that Marvel Studio hasn't officially revealed the chronological order for the Loki series, and its timeline mixes up with many phase-4 movies of Marvel Studio.</h4>
<p>Now, we will describe all the Marvel movies mentioned in the above list with a brief description of each of them.</p>
<h3 class="h3">1. Iron Man (2008)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order1.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>Iron Man was the first release of Marvel Studio's movies, released in the year 2008. Although it was not as successful as the prior franchise of Spider-Man, however, it was still capable of putting an impression. With the revenue of $585.2 million, it became the eighth highest-grossing film of the year.</p>
<h3 class="h3">2. The Incredible Hulk (2008)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order2.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>The Incredible Hulk casting Edward Norton was the next release of the Marvel series after the Iron Man. It was improved as compared to its precursors and earned $263.4 million.</p>
<p>Achievements of Iron Man had an impact on the popularity of the movie. However, it was understandable that who will be Marvel's flagship character among these two. However, the character gained enough achievements and fruition by doing subsidiary roles in various movies.</p>
<h3 class="h3">3. Iron Man 2 (2010)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order3.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>Marvel Studios brought a movie in 2010, Iron Man 2. The direction was done by Jon Favreau, and the script was prepared by Justin Theroux. The movie earned $623.9 million at the box office, becoming the seventh highest-grossing film of the year. But it was an ultimate approval of the Super hero in 2010. Unluckily, the common accord of Iron Man 2 was that it could not match the impact of the first film's popularity.</p>
<h3 class="h3">4. Thor (2011)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order4.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>Dissimilar to the Iron Man movies, Thor was not the best-grossing released film of 2011. The film made the revenue of $449.3 million and proceeded ahead from the Hulk and Captain America. Critics applauded Chris Hemsworth's work in the film, and some were still questioning the capability of Marvel's franchise. They marked the shortcomings in Thor, which made the Iron Man more splendid.</p>
<h3 class="h3">5. Captain America- The First Avenger (2011)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order5.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>Marvel studio released its fifth movie also in 2011, i.e., 'Captain America- The first Avenger.' Chris Evans played Captain America as the lead role in the movie, and this movie marked the entrance of Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). So, it may surprise many new marvel fans, but yes, Thor, Hulk, and Iron Man all have their movies before Captain America.</p>
<h3 class="h3">6. The Avengers (2012)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order6.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>Finally, the Marvel studios came up with the "The Avengers" in 2012. The movie reached up the peak of success at the box office and left behind many of its tough competitors, including "The Dark Knight rises," which was a sequel of Iron man. The movie became the first Marvel movie that earned the proofing billion dollars, i.e., 1.5 billion dollars. The profit and success earned by the film are still unmatched until the release of "Avenger- Infinity war" after six years.</p>
<h3 class="h3">7. Iron Man 3 (2013)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order7.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>The movie made the revenue of 1.2 billion dollars and became the second movie to cross the billion dollars earning. Shane Black made a debut as a director that brought a big evolution of Tony Stark.</p>
<p>Finally, the critics were satisfied with the storyline and applauded the movie as betterment of Iron man 2, which was much better in the action-comedy genre. The movie was the biggest blockbuster of the year.</p>
<h3 class="h3">8. Thor: The Dark World (2013)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order8.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>The movie made revenue of $644.6 million in the box office and became the tenth highest-grossing year of the year and was far better than the original one leaving behind Iron Man 2. Even after the ill-famed reputation of the film, it was not possible for the viewers to go and watch the movie.</p>
<h3 class="h3">9. Captain America: The Winter Soldier</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order9.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>Captain America received mixed interest and satisfactory feedbacks. The movie established itself as the powerhouse of the Marvel series with a box office gross of $714.3 million. Critics applauded the film and its political subtext, which is only attempted by very few superhero movies.</p>
<p>The direction of the Russo Brothers and the script written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely did a phenomenal job, and the results were the proof for that.</p>
<h3 class="h3">10. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order10.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>In 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy was a movie that was highly successful in pushing the boundaries of viewer's interest. The film gathered $773.3 million that was way too higher than any Thor or Captain America.</p>
<p>Transformers: Age of Extinction and 'The Hobbit and The Battle of the five Armies' were only the two stiff competitors. The critics felt a connection with the film's irrelevant humour and elegance and also with the sentiments possessed by its unusual superheroes.</p>
<h3 class="h3">11. Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order11.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>Age of Ultron was the movie that made the Marvel studios listed in the billion-dollar empire once again. The film accumulated $1.4 billion, which was lesser than the first Avengers but still exists in the territory of cinematic kingship.</p>
<p>Critics were not enough connected with the movie than the first movie. However, they adored the character interaction and the heroic moments in the movie.</p>
<h3 class="h3">12. Ant Man (2015)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order12.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>The Ant-Man became the next big release of the Marvel studios in order. The studio had high expectations from the movie that it would springboard the office of Ultron's profit that was fulfilled by the movie. It made revenue of $519.3 million which was not enough earning for the second phase. Either it was fatigue, or the marketing was unable to sell out the concepts as good as it did for the Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>
<p>Though, critics were fond of the Ant-Man and marked that the reduced scale of the movie performed in its goodwill and revived behind Paul Rudd's like potential as a well-intended but fighting father.</p>
<h3 class="h3">13. Captain America: Civil War (2016)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order13.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>Captain America: Civil War boosted the star-studded potential of an Avenger movie. The movie has beaten both Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and was declared the number one movie of the year in the box office.</p>
<p>With the earnings of $1.2 billion dollars, Captain America: Civil War became the fourth movie to accumulate the billion dollars earning.</p>
<h3 class="h3">14. Doctor Strange (2016)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order14.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>The movie was the second of the Third Phase of the Marvel series. This was the longest phase that was fully boasted by various latest characters. Doctor Strange gathered $677.7 million at the box office. Marvel Cinematic Universe was pushed into a new direction with its Doctor Strange that showed some very new plots and concepts. The story of the movie was mainly based on a doctor named Stephen strange who had a car accident and how their life changed from thereon.</p>
<h3 class="h3">15. Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order15.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>The Marvel movies gained achievements with two films per year, but in 2017 they added one more achievement in their schedule by coming up with three movies per year.</p>
<p>The second volume marginally better gathered a profit than the first volume, i.e., collection of $863.6 million. These were not the Civil War numbers, but carry on with being the achievement for the ragtag privilege. The Guardians showed the viewers their reliability even more than Thor. However, the original was a bit more magical, and the second volume could not carry that magic in it, but still, critics applauded the film and enjoyed it.</p>
<h3 class="h3">16. Spider-Man Homecoming (2017)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order16.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>The Spider-Man Homecoming is an amazing movie. The earliest Spider-Man movie released in 2002 made the revenue of $821.1 million which was boosted up to $890.9 million with the launch of Spider-Man 3.</p>
<p>Later, the profit was brought down to $700 million by "The Amazing Spider-Man", it wasn't that bad but a matter of concern for Sony.</p>
<p>By good fortune, Spider-Man Homecoming, the loss was healed with a profit of $880.2 million. Though the earning was not more than the Spider-Man 3 but still gave good feedback than the "The Amazing Spider-Man" and became the top-grossing superhero movie in 2017</p>
<h3 class="h3">17. Thor: Ragnar&ouml;k (2017)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order17.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>Thor: Ragnar&ouml;k stood at the third position in the success order of the three Marvel movies that were released in 2017. But the profit it made was $854 million and is no less than a prize for Marvel Studios.</p>
<p>Taika Waititi, the director of the film, was successful in making the film stand apart.</p>
<p>Critics totally enjoyed the comic direction of the film. The movie gained much success and not only this; it encouraged Chris Hemsworth to do the next project of Waititi, "Thor: Love and Thunder".</p>
<h3 class="h3">18. Black Panther (2018)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order18.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>Black Panther was adored by the Critics. The critics admired it for utilizing the superhero figure to spread a political message that reverberated with the present time viewers. The movie was impactful, which had certain significance to African and African - American viewers who viewed their honest reflections of themselves in the mythical stories of superheroes.</p>
<p>The popularity was clearly visible at the box office, with the revenue of $1.35 billion setting it in the billion dollars zone.</p>
<p>At the end of 2018, the movie established itself as the second top-grossing movie of the year and got nominated for the BEST PICTURE award, which solidified its significance to the audience and the company.</p>
<h3 class="h3">19. Avengers: Infinity War (2018)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order19.jpg" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>The movie shattered all the standard gross of all the movies launched by marvel studios by generating the revenue of $ 2 billion in the box office. The movie abolished past "The Avengers" to become the fourth top-grossing movie of all time.</p>
<p>Critics were unaware of the truth that this movie is not just a stand-alone appearance but were a wrap-up of all the Marvel movies in order. The movie got mixed interest from the audience.</p>
<p>Also, as Thanos rendered flawlessly on-screen, Josh Brolin's performance is a specialized marvel, the same as the narrative one.</p>
<h3 class="h3">20. Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order20.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>Ant-Man and the Wasp gathered $ 622 million across the world, which was much more than the original Ant-Man but a marked fall after the great success of Infinity War and Black Panther. Even the film was unable to match the level of Thor: The Dark World's grossing in the box office.</p>
<h3 class="h3">21. Captain Marvel (2019)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order21.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>2019 was the seller year for Disney, and Captain Marvel was the ace player in that. Because of the pre-sale numbers, it was behind the Black Panther and Infinity War; otherwise, it is the top listed movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. The movie accumulated $1.128 billion at the box office.</p>
<p>The interest of the audience in the character and its unconquerable brand value contributed a lot to the film's achievement by making it a must-watch movie. The critics thought they observed that the movie wasn't innovative, but the potential of the cast made the movie shine.</p>
<h3 class="h3">22. Avengers: Endgame (2019)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order22.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>In Avengers: Endgame, the heroes were cautioned by Thanos: "I am inevitable ". The Endgame was characterized as the climactic interpretation of all the Marvel movies. There was a guarantee that the film will be an end of the story for some centrepiece while concluding the thriller of Infinity War, which was already buzzing for a year. The movie smashed all the records, which were inevitable too. Star Wars: The Force Awakens possesses the domestic box office coronet, and Endgame exceeded it in the international market.</p>
<p>Subsequently, a long campaign by fans overthrew Avatar as the movie that reached the biggest collection in the box office with a profit of $2.8 billion. Critics were totally amazed by such a big profit scale of the film but also got surprised by the musing performance by the characters. The actors who have been part of the franchise from the beginning performed their best and contemplated midst the battles.</p>
<h3 class="h3">23. Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order23.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>This was the first time when all three movies of the Marvel studios in order smashed billion dollars in earnings in a year. The Spider-Man: Far from Homemade a profit of $1.1 billion. Sony was credited for the success of the movie but pulled from Disney's Endgame was a motivation.</p>
<p>Critics received a new benchmark for the familiar neighbourhood superhero. The film isn't up to that standard, but the film's potential to equalize its teen drama components with the result of Endgame did not go undiscovered.</p>
<h3 class="h3">24. WandaVision (2021)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order24.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
<p>WandaVision was the first television series of Marvel Studios streamed originally on the Disney+ Hotstar platform, and it was the 24th instalment of MCU that premiered its first episode in 2021. Before the WandaVision, there was a gap of almost 18 months for an instalment from Marvel that was the longest gap in the history of Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
<h3 class="h3">25. Falcon and The Winter Soldier (2021)</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order25.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order" />
