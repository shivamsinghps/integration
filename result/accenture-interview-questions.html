<div class="testanswer" id="answer14">
<p>Rewrite the given text into your own words so that it conveys the same message, but does not copy the original text word-for-word from the source.</p>
<p> Explanation:   
Speed of first train a = 10m/sec (150m/15sec). 
Suppose speed of second train b=x m/s. 
Train are moving in opposite direction, hence their speed = (10+x) m/sec &lt;relative&gt; 
therefore total distance to be covered = (150+150) = 300 
time=5 secs 
hence,  
Speed = distance/time 
10+x= 300/5 
X= 50m/sec</p>

<h2 class="h2 center">Accenture Second Round: Technical Interview Questions</h2>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">Java Interview questions:</h2>
<h2 class="h3">1) Why is Java called platform independent?</h2>
<p>Java's platform independence allows it to be executed on different operating systems such as Windows, Mac, or Linux. The reason behind Java's platform independence is due to the bytecode that is generated by the compiler when the code is written. The generated bytecode can be executed in any operating system, provided that the JDK is installed in that system. This unique feature of Java makes it highly portable and compatible with different platforms.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">2) What do you understand by Exception Handling?</h2>
<p>Exception handling plays a crucial role in managing exceptions that arise during program execution. Failure to handle these exceptions can result in program termination. To ensure a smooth program execution, it is essential to implement exception handling. This is done through several keywords including try, catch, throw, throws, and finally.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">3) What is checked and unchecked exception?</h2>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Checked exception</strong>: If the exception occurs or checked at compile time during the execution of a program, it is called as the checked exception. We should handle these exceptions using try-catch block or using throws keyword.<br>
E.g., if someone tries to read a file which is not present then it will throw a checked exception at compile time FileNotFoundException</li>
<li><strong>Unchecked exceptions</strong>: If the exception is not checked at compile time and occurred at runtime then this type of exception is called an unchecked exception. This type of exceptions occur due to an error in the logic of the code. If we do not handle this type of exception then also compiler will not give a compilation error.<br>
E.g. ArithmeticException</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">4) What are the reasons behind the occurrence of an exception?</h2>
<p>The following are the causes that can lead to the occurrence of an exception:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The act of trying to open or read a file that is not present or does not exist in a particular location.</li>
<li>Rewritten: "Performing the operation of dividing a variable by zero"</li>
<li>Reword this passage to avoid plagiarism:

"Adding an element to an array beyond its defined range"</li>
<li>"If a throw statement happens..."</li>
<li>The JVM has detected an unusual execution condition.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">5) What is OOP concept?</h2>
<p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a coding methodology that revolves around the creation and manipulation of objects and classes. Java, a popular programming language, follows this coding practice. OOP concentrates on concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Object</li>
<li>Class</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
<li>Abstraction </li>
<li>Encapsulation</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">6) Explain the basic features of OOPs.</h2>
<p>The fundamental characteristics of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) are as follows:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Object</strong>: - An object is a physical entity which has a state and behaviour. It occupies space in memory. It is a sample of a class. Object helps to access the methods and variables in the program.</li>
<li><strong>Class</strong> - A Class is "collection of objects." A class is a logical entity, which does not take any space. A class includes all the data and methods which shows the behaviour of an object.</li>
<li><strong>Inheritance</strong> - Inheritance is a process by which one class can have all properties of other class. Inheritance increases the code reusability. There are two terms used
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Child class (Subclass)</strong>: Class which inherits other class, called as Child class or derived class.</li>
<li><strong>Parent class (Superclass)</strong>: A class which got inherited by another class is termed as parent class or Base class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Polymorphism</strong>: - Polymorphism is a method of performing "a single task in different ways." Polymorphism enables a programmer to use methods or operators in different ways. In Java, we use method overloading and overriding to obtain the polymorphism.</li>
<li><strong>Abstraction</strong>: If we show only functionality and hide the explanations or details then this process is called as Abstraction. For achieving the abstraction, we use two ways in Java
<ul class="points">
<li>Abstract class</li>
<li>Interface</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Encapsulation</strong>: Encapsulation is a process of enclosing the data and code together to form a single unit. It makes the data safer within the code for any modification. For achieving the encapsulation, we can declare the data variables of class as private.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">7) Differentiate between class and object.</h2>
<p>Both class and object are essential components of object-oriented programming. However, they have distinct differences. The following outlines the fundamental distinctions between these two concepts.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>A class is a concept or idea while an object is a tangible thing or entity. The former is a logical representation, while the latter is a physical manifestation.</li>
<li>When you create a class in programming, it does not take up any space in memory. However, when you create an object based on that class, it will occupy a certain amount of space in memory.</li>
<li>To define a class in Java, the keyword 'class' is used, which is followed by the name of the class. On the other hand, we can create an object in Java by using the 'new' keyword.</li>
<li>A Class can be seen as a production line that creates objects, with objects being the various instances of the Class.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">8) What is encapsulation in Java?</h2>
<p>Encapsulation is the practice of combining code and data into a single unit. A good analogy for this concept is a capsule containing medication.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>In Java, a class is considered to be fully encapsulated when all its data members are declared as private. By doing this, we restrict direct access to the data and instead use getter and setter methods to interact with it. This provides better control over the data and enhances security.</li>
<li>A Java Bean class is a good example of a fully encapsulated class.</li>
<li>Encapsulation ensures that a class's data is kept separate from other classes, which is why it is also referred to as data-hiding.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example for encapsulation:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class EncapsulationEg{
    private String empname;
    private int empage;
    private int empid; 
   
    public String getEmpName() //getter method 
    {
        return empname;
    }
    public int getEmpAge()
    {
        return empage;
    }
    public int getEmpId()
    {
        return empid;
    }
    public void setEmpName(String setvalue)  //setter methods 
{ 
        empname=setvalue;
    }
    public void setEmpAge(int setvalue){
        empage=setvalue;
    }
    public void setEmpId(int setvalue){
        empid=setvalue;
    }
    
    }
    public class TestEncapsulation{
        public static void main(String args[]){
        
         EncapsulationEg en= new  EncapsulationEg();
         en.setEmpName("Alvin");
        en.setEmpAge(22);
        en.setEmpId(12568);
         System.out.println("Employee Name: " +en.getEmpAge());
         System.out.println("Employee Age: " +en.getEmpAge());
         System.out.println("Employee ID: " +en.getEmpId());
    }
}

<h2 class="h3">11)	What do you understand by runtime polymorphism?</h2>
<p>Polymorphism refers to the ability to accomplish a specific task using multiple methods. This concept of polymorphism can be broadly classified into two types.</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Runtime Polymorphism</li>
<li>Compile-time polymorphism</li>
</ol>
<p>In this section, we will explore the concept of runtime polymorphism.</p>
<p>In Java programming language, the concept of runtime polymorphism can be implemented by method overriding. This involves replacing a method in the subclass with one that has the same signature as the method in the superclass. By doing this, the subclass can provide its own implementation of the method, allowing it to behave differently than the superclass's implementation.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class A{    //Superclass
void name()
{
System.out.println("this is student of Superclass");
}
}

class Student extends A  //Subclass
{
void name(){      // method Override with same signature(runtime polymorphism)
System.out.println("this is student of subclass");
}
public static void main (String[] args) {
A a= new A();    // refrence of A class
A b= new Student();   // refrence of student class

a.name();
b.name();
}
}
</textarea></div>

<hr>
<h2 class="h3">13) What are the keyword "super" and "this" in Java?</h2>
<p>The term "super" in Java is a reserved keyword which provides reference to the parent class object. It is not permissible to use "super" as an identifier in Java.</p>
<p>In Java programming language, the term "this" is used to indicate the current object belonging to the class being referred to. It is important to note that the usage of "this" cannot be used as a variable name or identifier as it is a reserved keyword.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">14)	What is an interface in Java? Can we implement multiple interfaces in one class?</h2>
<p>In the Java programming language, an interface is a tool used to implement abstraction. While similar to a class in some ways, an interface differs in that it can include methods and variables but does not provide an implementation for those methods. Instead, an interface only contains the signature of its methods.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>It is not possible to create an instance of Interface in Java.</li>
<li>The set of methods that a class must implement as part of an interface are public and abstract by default, meaning that they are accessible to all and do not have a method body.</li>
<li>One possible rephrasing of "A class can implement an interface" is:

It is possible for a class to utilize an interface in its implementation.</li>
<li>For declaring an interface, we use the keyword <strong>interface</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">interface Interface_Name{
//Methods
}
</textarea></div>
<p>It is possible to incorporate multiple interfaces in a single class by declaring parent interfaces using a comma (,) operator.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">public class A implements C, D {
Code 
}
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">15)	Explain inheritance in Java? How can it be achieved?</h2>
<ul class="points">
<li>Java provides a mechanism called inheritance, which allows one class to acquire the properties of another class. Essentially, inheritance enables one class to inherit all the methods and attributes of another class, thus inheriting its behavior as well.</li>
<li>The concept of inheritance is beneficial in terms of increasing code reusability.</li>
<li>The concept of inheritance is a critical aspect of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).</li>
<li>Inheritance is a way of expressing the relationship between two classes where one class is a subclass of another. This relationship represents an IS-A connection between the two classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the context of inheritance, there are two specific terms used to describe the process.</p>
<ol class="points">
<li><strong>Child class (Subclass)</strong>: Class which inherits other class, called a Child class or derived class. </li>
<li><strong>Parent class (Superclass)</strong>: A class which got inherited by another class is termed as parent class or Base class.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Consider the following example of Java inheritance syntax.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">Class A extends B     // Here A represents subclass and B represent Superclass
{
// Code 
}
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">16) Can we use multiple inheritance in Java? Explain with reason?</h2>
<p>It is not possible to utilize multiple inheritance in Java programming language as it introduces ambiguity and the diamond problem. An approach to avoid this issue is to implement interfaces in Java instead.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a scenario where Class A inherits two parent classes, B and C. However, both parent classes have a method with the same name. If Class A attempts to override this method, it would create confusion for the compiler and result in a compilation error. As a result of this issue, Java does not support multiple inheritance.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">17) What can we do if we want to access a private member of a class?</h2>
<p>In Java, it is possible to retrieve access to private members of a class by utilizing public getters and setters from external sources.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">18)	What is the significance of "static" keyword?</h2>
<ul class="points">
<li>The static keyword in Java modifies non-access elements like methods, variables, blocks, and nested classes.</li>
<li>Static Keywords are a component of a class and are not associated with an instance of the class.</li>
<li>The Java language incorporates the "static" keyword to enable effective memory management. This keyword can be used with variables, blocks, and methods in order to achieve the desired result.</li>
<li>In Java, a static property is a class-level property that can be accessed and shared by all instances of the class.</li>
<li>We can access static members of a class without creating an instance of that class.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">19) What is "Collection Framework" in Java?</h2>
<p>The Collection Framework is a programming structure in Java that provides a way to store and manipulate data as objects using a variety of classes and interfaces. There are two key interfaces that make up the Collection Framework.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Java.util.Collection</li>
<li>Java.util.Map</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">20) What is List interface in collections?</h2>
<p>The List interface is an essential part of the Java Collection Framework, which provides a set of interfaces and classes for handling collections of objects. In particular, the List interface extends the Collection interface, providing additional functionality for working with lists of elements.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>A sequence is a grouping of items in an arranged manner.</li>
<li>The set has multiple instances of the same element.</li>
<li>This data structure stores elements in an ordered sequence, and is efficient at inserting and deleting elements at any position within the sequence. In addition, random access of elements is facilitated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">public interface List&lt;E&gt; extends Collection&lt;E&gt;
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">21) What do you understand by object cloning?</h2>
<p>Object cloning is a way of making an identical copy of an object. It involves using the clone() method of the Object class. However, for the clone() method to work, the class needs to implement the java.lang.Clonable interface. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown.</p>
<p><strong>The function of clone() method will be restated without directly copying the original sentence.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">22) Can we insert duplicate values in Set?</h2>
<p>When using a Set, it is not possible to add the same element twice. If a duplicate element is attempted to be added, only the unique elements will be displayed in the output.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">23) What is the difference between Collections, and Collection in Java?</h2>
<p>Both Collection and collections are components of the Java Collection Framework. However, there are key distinctions between the two.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The Collection interface and Collections class are both part of the Java collection framework. While the former is an interface, the latter is a concrete class.</li>
<li>The Collection interface offers a range of methods that are applicable to various data structures, whereas the Collections class provides a set of static methods that can be applied for performing operations on collections.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">24)	What is "Diamond problem" in Java? How can it be removed?</h2>
<p>When working with multiple inheritance in programming, a common issue known as the Diamond problem can arise. However, it's important to note that Java does not allow for multiple inheritance. Instead, a similar issue can arise with interfaces. If we implement two interfaces that have methods with the same signature, it can create ambiguity for the compiler and lead to a compile time error. This issue is referred to as the Diamond problem due to its structural resemblance to a diamond shape.</p>
<p><strong>Sure, here's my attempt at rephrasing it:

For instance, to illustrate the concept of the diamond problem, we can look at a specific example.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">interface InterfaceA {
default public void m1() { System.out.println("This is interface A!"); }

}
interface InterfaceB {

<h2 class="h3">25) What is an abstract class in Java?</h2>
<ul class="points">
<li>In Java programming, Abstract classes are utilized to accomplish abstraction. We can create an abstract class using the "abstract" keyword followed by the class name. This type of class is referred to as an abstract class.</li>
<li>It is possible for an Abstract class to contain methods that do not have an implementation, as well as methods that do have some implementation.</li>
<li>It is not possible to create an instance of an abstract class.</li>
<li>It is not a requirement for an abstract class to contain an abstract method.</li>

<h2 class="h3">26) What is deadlock condition in multithreading?</h2>
<p>A deadlock situation can arise in the case of multithreading. This happens when one thread is waiting to acquire a lock on an object that has already been locked by another thread, and the second thread is waiting for the lock on the same object that has been taken by the first thread. This scenario is referred to as a deadlock condition in Java.</p>

<h2 class="h3">27) Differentiate between Collection and array.</h2>
<p>The Collection and Array have similar functions in terms of data storage, but there are fundamental distinctions between the two.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>In programming, arrays have a set size that cannot be altered during runtime. On the other hand, collections allow for dynamic resizing of their contents.</li>
<li>Arrays are limited to storing objects of the same type or homogeneous objects, whereas Collections are capable of storing both homogeneous and heterogeneous objects.</li>
<li>Although arrays are useful for storing and accessing a collection of elements, they do not have built-in methods to perform tasks such as sorting or searching. On the other hand, Collections provide pre-made methods that make these operations easier for users to execute.</li>
<li>In terms of performance, arrays have an advantage over collections. However, they require more memory space compared to collections.</li>

<h2 class="h3">28) What is call by value and call by reference?</h2>
<p>In C programming language, there are two methods to transfer data values to functions, known as parameters.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Call by Value</li>
<li>Call by reference</li>
</ul>
<p>When using call by value, a duplicate of the value is transferred to the function. Thus, modifying formal parameters will not have an impact on the original parameters. If changes are made to the value of the formal parameter in the calling function, it is perceived as a local variable and will not impact the original value.</p>
<p>Call by reference is a parameter passing technique in which the function receives the memory address of the actual parameter instead of its value. If any changes are made in the formal parameters, the corresponding actual parameter also gets impacted.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">29) Explain dynamic memory and static memory allocation.</h2>
<p>There exist two methods for distributing memory:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Static memory allocation</strong>: The allocation of memory at the starting of the program is called static memory allocation. In static memory allocation size remains fix i.e. we cannot change the size at runtime. Static memory allocation is used in Array.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic memory allocation</strong>: The allocation of memory at runtime is called as dynamic memory allocation. We can specify a size at runtime as per need. The memory gets allocated from heap area, and it can also be deallocated from same. Dynamic memory allocation used in pointers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h3">30)	What is difference between "var++" and "++var"?</h2>
<p>Both (var++) and (++var) are programming expressions used to increase the value of a variable named 'var'.</p>
<p>The primary contrast between var++ and ++var is that the former evaluates the statement before incrementing the value by one, while the latter increments the value by one before evaluating the expression.</p>
<p><strong>E.g.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main()
{
int a,b;
a=5, b=1;
printf("%d %d", a++, a);   //will generate 5, 6 as output
printf("%d %d", ++b, b);    //will generate 2, 2 as output
)

<h2 class="h3">31) Differentiate between class and structure in C++.</h2>
<p>The terms "class" and "structure" are quite similar, but there are some differences between them. Both terms describe a group of related data members. However, the specifics of how the data is organized and used may differ.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>By default, the class members are private while the structure members are public. This means that when accessing members of a class, they cannot be accessed from outside the class, unlike members of a structure which can be accessed publicly.</li>
<li>In the programming language called C++, a class is a collective section consisting of functions, variables, and objects that are related to each other. On the other hand, structure is a custom data type that is created by the user itself and performs its operations accordingly.</li>
<li>One way to specify a class is by using the keyword "class," while a structure can be defined using the keyword "struct."</li>
<li>A class's objects are created on the heap memory, while a structure's objects are created on the stack memory.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">32) What are the access specifiers in C++?</h2>
<p>An access specifier is a feature in C++ programming that helps to control access to class members and implement data hiding. Keywords are used within the class body to define the access specifier. These keywords limit the visibility of class members to prevent unwanted access.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Public</strong>: If we specify a class member as public then it will be accessible from anywhere within a program. We can directly access the private member of one class from another class.</li>
<li><strong>Private</strong>: If we specify any class member as private then it will only be accessed by the function of that class only. We cannot access the private member of the class outside the class.</li>
<li><strong>Protected</strong>: Protected access specifier is mainly used in case of inheritance. If we define the class member as protected, then we cannot access class member outside the class, but we can access it by subclass or derived class of that class.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sure, here's a rephrased version:

Here's an example to understand the access specifier feature in C++. This feature controls the visibility and accessibility of class members (variables and functions) from different parts of a program. By specifying access specifiers, we can restrict the access of certain class members to only specific parts of the program. In C++, there are three access specifiers: public, protected, and private. Each of these access specifiers controls the level of visibility and accessibility of class members.</strong></p>

<h2 class="h3">34)	What does "main()" function in C++? Can we run a program without main method?</h2>
<p>The main() function serves as the starting point for a program written in the C++ programming language. It is the first function that is executed as soon as the program begins running, playing a crucial role as the entry point for all program operations.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax for main():</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">void main(){

</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">35) What is the declaration and definition of a variable?</h2>
<p>Declaring a variable or function is a process of assigning a name and its type within a program, enabling it to be utilized by the compiler. By defining a member, we provide its representation within the program for further use.</p>
<p><strong>e.g.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">extern int x;
extern char  y;     // It tells the compiler that there are two variables x and y of types char and int
</textarea></div>
<p>To define a variable means to give it a value or initialize it with a value. This provides complete information about the variable or any other member of the program.</p>
<p><strong>e.g.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">int x= 2;
char y = 'A',  'B';    // It defines the variable  x and y by giving its value or body.
</textarea></div>

<h2 class="h3">36)	What do you understand by Friend function?</h2>
<p>In C++, a friend function is a special type of function that can access private and protected members of another class in which it is declared as a friend. This can be achieved by using the keyword "friend" when declaring the function. There are two types of friend functions.</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Provide an alternative way to access the functions of a different class.</li>
<li>A global function</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class Class_Name {
//Line of code
friend return-type func_name() ;}

<h2 class="h3">37) What is memory allocation in C?</h2>
<p>Memory allocation involves setting aside a specific portion of memory space for program execution, according to programming requirements.</p>
<p>In C programming language, memory allocation can be broadly classified into two types.</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Static memory allocation</li>
<li>Dynamic memory allocation</li>
</ol>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Static memory allocation</strong>: The allocation of memory at the starting of the program is called static memory allocation. In static memory allocation size remains fix, i.e., we cannot change the size at runtime. Static memory allocation is used in Array.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic memory allocation</strong>: The allocation of memory at runtime is called as dynamic memory allocation. We can specify a size at runtime as per need. The memory gets allocated from heap area, and it can also be deallocated from same. Dynamic memory allocation used in pointers. There are four types of the predefined function used for dynamic memory allocation
<ol class="points">
<li>malloc()</li>
<li>calloc()</li>
<li>free()</li>
<li>realloc()</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">38)	Differentiate between malloc() and calloc()?</h2>
<p>The standard library function <stdlib.h> provides two ways of allocating dynamic memory during program execution: malloc() and calloc(). These functions have several differences, as outlined below.</stdlib.h></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The term malloc() refers to the allocation of memory, whereas calloc() refers to the allocation of contiguous memory space.</li>
<li>The function malloc() assigns memory in a singular block while the function calloc() allocates memory in multiple blocks.</li>
<li>When it comes to allocating memory in programming, there are two commonly used functions: malloc() and calloc(). The main difference between the two is that malloc() only requires one argument, which is the size of the block to be allocated. On the other hand, calloc() requires two arguments: the number of blocks to be allocated and the size of each block.</li>
<li>According to the characteristics of C language, the malloc() function is known to be faster than the calloc() function for memory allocation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here's a possible rephrased version of the original content:

The syntax used for the malloc() function typically consists of the function name followed by a set of parentheses. Inside the parentheses, you may include arguments such as the number of bytes of memory to allocate. This function is often used in C and C++ programming to dynamically allocate memory during runtime.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">ptr=  (type_cast*)  malloc( size_t size );
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Sure, here's a rephrased version: 

The syntax for the calloc() function refers to the way in which the function is written and called in a programming language. It is a function that allocates memory for an array of elements, initializes the memory to zero, and returns a pointer to the first element of the array. The syntax for calloc() varies depending on the specific programming language being used.</strong></p>

<h2 class="h3">39)	Why is C a procedural language?</h2>
<p>A procedural language is characterized by its usage of predetermined procedures and patterns. To be more specific, the C language falls under this category as programmers are required to strictly abide by a set pattern or flow when coding. Essentially, C language adopts a top-down methodology in tackling issues. Its primary emphasis is on the program's flow rather than the data.</p>

<h2 class="h3">2) What is normalization? What are its types?</h2>
<p>Normalization entails the systematic organization of database information to decrease data redundancy and ensure data integrity. The process is also referred to as data normalization or database normalization.</p>
<p>Organizing data into tables and columns enables us to normalize it, which involves defining relationships between these elements. This step is essential for effective database management.</p>
<p>Here are some common types of normalization that are widely used:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>One possible rephrased version could be: 
The concept of First Normal Form, or 1NF, refers to a set of rules for organizing data in a relational database. These rules serve to ensure that each piece of data is atomic, or indivisible, and that each record in a table contains only one value for each attribute. By following these guidelines, data can be structured in a consistent and logical manner that facilitates efficient database management and querying.</li>
<li>Sure, here's a rephrased version: 

The Second Normal Form (2NF) is a database normalization technique used to eliminate data redundancy and improve data accuracy. It involves breaking down tables into smaller tables based on the relationships between their attributes. To achieve 2NF, ensure that all non-key attributes in a table are dependent upon the primary key. If any non-key attribute is dependent on another non-key attribute, it should be moved to a separate table. This helps in maintaining data consistency and reduces the risk of data anomalies.</li>
<li>"Third normal form (3NF)" needs to be paraphrased to avoid plagiarism. Here's an example: 

The third normal form or 3NF is a database normalization technique used to eliminate repetitive data. It requires that every non-primary key column is dependent on the primary key in a table, and no non-primary key column depends on another non-primary key column. This helps minimize data redundancy and inconsistencies in a database.</li>
<li>Boyce &amp; Codd normal form (BCNF)</li>
<li>Fourth normal form(4NF)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">3)	Explain the "primary key," "foreign key," and "UNIQUE key" in Database?</h2>
<p>A primary key is a crucial component of a database table, as it serves as a unique identifier for each row within the table. The primary key must have a distinct value for each row, and it cannot contain null values. Typically, a primary key is utilized as a clustered index by default.</p>
<p>A unique key serves a similar function to a primary key but with the allowance for a single null value and disallowance of duplicate values. It is commonly utilized as a non-clustered index.</p>
<p>A foreign key is a crucial element in relational databases used to link two tables. It establishes a relationship between the second table and the primary key or unique key of the first table. A foreign key can have multiple null values and can be defined multiple times in a table.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">4) What is XML in DBMS? Explain its types?</h2>
<ul class="points">
<li>XML in database termed as "<strong>eXtensible Markup Language.</strong>"</li>
<li>An XML database is a specialized system that is tailored to manage large amounts of data in the format of XML, as well as transfer such data between applications and systems.</li>
<li>XML database is primarily associated with document-based databases.<br>
There are two types of XML database used which are:<br>
<ol class="points">
<li>XML-enabled</li>
<li>Native XML </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An XML-enabled Database is similar to a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) in that it allows for the storage of data in tables with columns and rows. However, it is specifically designed to handle the conversion of XML documents.</p>
<p>A native XML database is a type of database that stores information in containers instead of tables. It is capable of storing a large amount of data and allows users to query the data with X-path expressions. This type of database is specifically designed to handle XML data.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">5) Differentiate between CHAR and VARCHAR2?</h2>
<p>In a database, we utilize CHAR and VARCHAR2 to store string values. However, there exist distinct dissimilarities between the two terms.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The key difference between CHAR and VARCHAR data types is that CHAR has a fixed size whereas VARCHAR size depends on the actual string being stored.</li>
<li>If we choose to store a string using a CHAR data type, it will occupy a specific amount of memory as per our defined size. However, with the use of the VARCHAR2 data type, memory allocation is determined dynamically based on the size of the string. As a result, utilizing VARCHAR2 enables us to use memory more efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">6) Differentiate between DELETE and TRUNCATE command in SQL?</h2>
<p>There are two different commands that can be utilized to remove a row from a table. These include the TABLE and TRUNCATE commands.</p>
<p>The following are the key distinctions between the two commands:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>TRUNCATE and DELETE are two different commands in database management. TRUNCATE is classified as a Data Definition Language (DDL) command, while DELETE is classified as one of the Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands.</li>
<li>The DELETE command is used to eliminate specific rows from a table, while the TRUNCATE command is used to remove all rows from a table.</li>
<li>When using the DELETE command in SQL, omitting the WHERE clause will result in the entire table being deleted. However, the container space will not be freed up. The TRUNCATE command, on the other hand, will remove the entire table and free up the space that it was occupying. Unlike DELETE, WHERE clause cannot be used with TRUNCATE.</li>
<li>The DELETE and TRUNCATE commands in SQL differ in their functionality. Specifically, when performing a DELETE operation on a table, the identity of the table is not reset. However, with TRUNCATE, the identity of the table can be reset.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>"Plagiarism-free" rephrasing: 

The DELETE command in SQL is used to delete data from a table. Its syntax involves specifying the table name, followed by the keyword DELETE, and then using the WHERE clause to specify which rows should be deleted. It is important to be cautious when using the DELETE command, as it permanently removes data from the table and cannot be undone.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE condition]; // WHERE clause is optional to use.
</textarea></div>
<p>The DELETE command will eliminate the specified rows from a table based on the conditions defined in the WHERE clause.</p>
<p><strong>To avoid plagiarism, the information given can be rephrased as follows: 

The TRUNCATE command has a specific syntax that is used to delete all data from a table in a database. It is important to use this command with caution because it permanently deletes the data and cannot be undone. The syntax of the TRUNCATE command should be properly followed to ensure that the intended table is affected.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
</textarea></div>
<p>When you delete a table, the entire dataset within it will be permanently removed from the database. This action also releases the space previously occupied by the table in the database.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">7) What is DML command in DBMS?</h2>
<p>DML stands for Data Manipulation Language and refers to SQL commands that are used for manipulating data. These commands are specific to altering, deleting, and updating data in a database. Common DML commands include:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>SELECT</strong>- This command is used for retrieval of the data from the table of given database.</li>
<li><strong>INSERT</strong>- This command is used to insert or add the data into the table.</li>
<li><strong>UPDATE</strong>- This command is used to update the existing data in the table.</li>
<li><strong>DELETE</strong>- This command can be used to remove the records from the table.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h3">8) Why do we use DBMS?</h2>
<p>A DBMS, short for DataBase Management System, is a tool used to manage and process data.</p>
<p>The utilization of DBMS can be traced through various ways:</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>The database construction process will be carried out to create a structured collection of data for efficient storage, retrieval, and use.</li>
<li>The process of overseeing and organizing the information stored in a database.</li>
<li>Rewriting: 
The process of refreshing information stored in a database.</li>

<h2 class="h3">9) Differentiate between "Hot Backup" and "Cold Backup" in the database?</h2>
<p>There are two methods available to backup data in a database.</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Cold backup</li>
<li>Hot backup</li>
</ol>
<p>A cold backup, also known as an offline backup, is a type of physical backup used to secure data and control files. It is performed while the database is offline and no users are logged in. During a cold backup, files are copied without the risk of any alterations. This makes it a highly secure method of data backup. Examples of cold backup methods include unplugging a USB drive or an external hard drive after each backup.</p>
<p>Hot Backup, also known as Online-backup, is a type of physical backup that is implemented while the database is operational for all users. This backup method carries some risk as it is exposed and accessible to all users. Its main use case is for taking complete database backups. To perform a hot backup, Oracle recommends using the Recovery Manager (RMAN) method.</p>

<h2 class="h3">10) What are ON DELETE CASCADE options in DB table?</h2>
<p>MySQL offers a useful method for deleting data from a database table known as the ON DELETE CASCADE option. This function operates in conjunction with the foreign key, ensuring that if data is removed from the parent table, the corresponding data in the child table is automatically deleted.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">11) What is the AVL tree? What is its significance?</h2>
<p>The AVL tree was created by Adelson-Velsky and Landis and is named after them. It is a type of self-balancing binary search tree that is height-balanced. This means that the tree is designed to keep the height of its nodes relatively equal as data is added or removed from the tree.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The AVL tree has a balancing factor associated with each of its nodes.</li>
<li>To ensure balance in a tree structure, it's essential to calculate the balancing factor. This factor represents the allowable difference between the heights of the left and right sub-trees, which must not exceed one for each node in the tree.</li>
</ul>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">Balance Factor (k) = height (left (k)) - height (right (k))
</textarea></div>
<p>The time complexity for insertion in an AVL tree is O(log n) because of its balanced nature. As its height is limited to O(log(n)), the time taken for insertion is also limited to this value.</p>
<p>AVL tree is a self-balanced binary search tree that offers better performance than regular binary search trees. While binary search trees can experience reduced performance when they are unbalanced, AVL trees maintain balance, ensuring a time complexity of O(log(n)). This makes AVL trees an important data structure for applications where fast searching is essential.</p>
