</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">7) What are the types of Machine Learning?</h3>
<p>The field of Machine Learning can be classified into three primary categories:</p>
<ol class="pointsa">
<li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Supervised learning is a type of Machine learning in which the machine needs external supervision to learn from data. The supervised learning models are trained using the labeled dataset. <strong>Regression</strong> and <strong>Classification</strong> are the two main problems that can be solved with Supervised Machine Learning.</li>
<li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> It is a type of machine learning in which the machine does not need any external supervision to learn from the data, hence called unsupervised learning. The unsupervised models can be trained using the unlabelled dataset. These are used to solve the Association and Clustering problems.</li>
<li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> In Reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with its environment by producing actions, and learn with the help of feedback. The feedback is given to the agent in the form of rewards, such as for each good action, he gets a positive reward, and for each bad action, he gets a negative reward. There is no supervision provided to the agent. Q-Learning algorithm is used in reinforcement learning.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">8) Explain the term "Q-Learning."</h3>
<p>Q-learning is a well-known method utilized in reinforcement learning that is founded on the Bellman equation. In this methodology, the agent endeavors to acquire optimal policies that will assist in maximizing rewards under specific scenarios by learning from previous experiences. By doing so, the agent takes the best actions using the learned policies.</p>
<p>Q-learning is an algorithm wherein the value Q is employed to indicate the desirability of taking each possible action at a given state. The objective of the agent is to maximize the Q value by making the best possible decisions at each state.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">9) What is Deep Learning, and how is it used in real-world?</h3>
<p>Deep learning is an advanced branch of machine learning that imitates the cognitive functioning of the human brain. It relies on neural networks to perform complex tasks and can be referred to as deep neural learning or deep neural networks. It is a powerful tool used to solve intricate real-world problems.</p>
<p>There are several practical uses of deep learning in various fields.</p>
<ul class="points">

Machine learning is a specific field within AI that focuses on developing algorithms and models to enable machines to learn and make decisions based on data without explicit human programming. AI is a broader concept that includes various technologies and applications aiming to mimic human-like intelligence. One way to understand their relationship is that AI leverages machine learning algorithms and techniques to solve complex problems.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/ai-interview-questions-q12.png" alt="AI Interview Questions">
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">13) What is Markov's Decision process?</h3>
<p>The Markov decision process (MDP) can be utilized to address a reinforcement learning problem, as it serves as a formalized approach. Essentially, the MDP provides a mathematical framework to solve these types of problems and achieve the desired goal of obtaining the maximum reward by selecting the optimal policy. The ultimate objective is to optimize the decision-making process and arrive at the most favorable outcome.</p>
<p>The concept of MDP is made up of four fundamental elements.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>A group of states that is limited in number and finite in quantity is referred to as a set of finite states.</li>
<li>A group of limited activities, denoted as A.</li>
<li>Rewards</li>
<li>Policy P<sub>a</sub></li>
</ul>
<p>The decision-making process of an agent is known as the reinforcement learning process. This process involves taking an action that transitions the agent from its current state to a new state while receiving rewards. The policy for the agent is a set of actions that lead it from the start state to the end state.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">14) What do you understand by the reward maximization?</h3>
<p>In reinforcement learning, the objective of the learning agent is to maximize the rewards it receives for taking certain actions. This is achieved by the agent receiving positive feedback when it successfully transitions from one state to another, such as receiving a reward for making a good decision. Conversely, if the agent performs an undesirable action, the reward may be subtracted. The overall goal is for the agent to make decisions that result in the highest possible rewards, which is referred to as reward maximization.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">15) What are parametric and non-parametric model?</h3>
<p>Machine learning models can be classified into two categories: Parametric and Non-parametric models. These models are built using predictor variables which are referred to as parameters. The following is a brief overview of these two types of models.</p>
<p> Parametric Model:  The parametric models use a fixed number of the parameters to create the ML model. It considers strong assumptions about the data. The examples of the parametric models are Linear regression, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Perceptron, etc.</p>
<p>The non-parametric model is a type of statistical model that does not make rigid assumptions about the data and instead uses a flexible number of parameters. These models are well-suited for large datasets and situations where little prior knowledge is available. Some examples of non-parametric models include decision trees, K-nearest neighbor, and support vector machines with Gaussian kernels.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">16) What do you understand by the hyperparameter?</h3>
<p>Hyperparameters are parameters that play a crucial role in determining and controlling the entire training process in machine learning. They are external to the model and include variables such as hidden layers, learning rate, activation functions, hidden units, and others. The selection of appropriate hyperparameters is critical to building effective algorithms.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">17) Explain the Hidden Markov model.</h3>
<p>A hidden Markov model is a statistical technique used to represent probability distributions over a sequence of observations. It assumes that the state of a process generated at a particular time is hidden from the observer, and that the process satisfies the Markov property. This model is particularly useful for analyzing temporal data.</p>
<p>The HMM (hidden Markov model) is a versatile tool with applications in several fields, including but not limited to reinforcement learning and temporal pattern recognition.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">18) What is Strong AI, and how is it different from the Weak AI?</h3>
<p>Strong AI is focused on developing genuine intelligence through artificial means - this refers to creating an intelligence that possesses characteristics like emotions, self-awareness, and sentiments similar to humans. The ultimate goal of strong AI is to create AI entities that are capable of thinking, reasoning, and making decisions in a manner similar to humans, thereby mimicking true human intelligence.</p>
<p>Weak AI is a stage of advancement in artificial intelligence that focuses on developing intelligent machines and agents to assist humans in solving complex real-world problems. Programs such as Siri and Alexa are examples of weak AI software.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">19) Give a brief introduction to the Turing test in AI?</h3>
<p>The Turing test is a well-known type of intelligence assessment that falls within the field of Artificial Intelligence. It was conceptualized by Alan Turing in 1950. The test seeks to verify whether a machine or computer has human-like thinking capabilities. Passing the test means that the machine can produce responses that are akin to those of a human being in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>The experiment involves three participants: a computer, a human respondent, and a human interrogator. The interrogator's task is to identify which responses come from the machine by asking questions and receiving answers.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">20) Which assessment is used to test the intelligence of the machine?</h3>
<p>Turing Test. </p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">21) What is overfitting? How can it be overcome in Machine Learning?</h3>
<p>Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning wherein the algorithm tries to capture all the data points, including the noise, resulting in a high variance and low bias in the output. This issue arises due to the algorithm's attempt to fit the model perfectly to the training data, which may not generalize well to new data. Overfitting is a significant concern in machine learning, and techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, and feature selection can help mitigate this problem.</p>
<p><strong>Ways to prevent overfitting in machine learning:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Cross-Validation</li>
<li>Expanding the quantity of data used in training.</li>
<li>Regularization</li>
<li>Ensembling</li>
<li>Removing Unnecessary Features</li>
<li>Halting the training process before it reaches its maximum iterations to prevent overfitting is known as early stopping.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">22) Tell one technique to avoid overfitting in neural networks?</h3>
<p>The dropout technique is widely used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. It's a form of regularization that involves randomly dropping selected neurons during training. This helps to avoid the network becoming too specialized to the training data.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">23) What is NLP? What are the various components of NLP?</h3>
<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that deals with computers' ability to comprehend, interpret, and manipulate human language.</p>
<p><strong>Components of NLP:</strong></p>
<p>The field of Natural Language Processing has two primary components. These two components are outlined below.</p>

<h3 class="h3">46) Give the steps for A* algorithm?</h3>
<p>The A* algorithm is a well-known form of the Best First Search strategy. It is used to identify the shortest path to the desired endpoint through heuristic and cost-based evaluation. In order to execute this algorithm, the following stages must be completed:</p>
<p>Begin the algorithm by adding the initial node to the OPEN list.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is necessary to verify whether the OPEN list is devoid of any items. If the list is found to be empty, then the failure is returned, and the process is discontinued.</p>
<p>In the third step of the A* algorithm, we need to choose a node from the OPEN list which has the lowest value of the evaluation function (consisting of the cost to reach the node and the estimated cost to reach the goal). If the selected node is the goal node, then we can return a success message and stop the algorithm. However, if the selected node is not the goal node, we need to move on to the next step.</p>
<p>The fourth step of the A* search algorithm involves expanding node n and creating all its possible successors. The expanded node is added to the list of closed nodes. Each successor n' is checked to see if it already exists in the open or closed list. If it does not, the evaluation function is computed for n' and it is added to the open list.</p>
<p>In the fifth step of the A* algorithm, if the current node n' is already present in both the OPEN and CLOSED lists, we need to update the back pointer to reflect the lowest g(n') value.</p>
<p>Step 6 involves repeating Step 2 again.</p>

Though not always providing the best possible solution, the heuristic method ensures to find an acceptable solution in a reasonable amount of time. Essentially, the heuristic function estimates the distance between a current state and the desired outcome and is represented by the value h(n), which estimates the optimal path's cost between two states. Additionally, it's important to note that the function's value is always positive.</p>
<p>The criterion for the suitability of the heuristic function is provided as:</p>
