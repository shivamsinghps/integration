<h1 class="h1">SQL Interview Questions and Answers</h1>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/sql-interview-questions.PNG" alt="SQL Interview Questions" class="imageright">
<p>The subsequent list presents some common and practical interview questions and answers about SQL for both entry-level and seasoned applicants. These queries are constructed to aid you in getting comfortable with the types of inquiries you might encounter during your SQL interview. Typically, interviewers do not intentionally focus on any particular topic during the interview and start with a fundamental comprehension of the topic. Following that, based on your answers, they will continue the discussion.</p>
<h3 class="h3">1) What is SQL?</h3>
<p>SQL is a widely used language for managing relational databases that was first created in 1970. It is known for its ability to perform various data manipulation tasks, such as adding, removing and modifying rows. SQL is used for managing data entities and their relationships within a structured database. It is often abbreviated as "sequel."</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">2) When SQL appeared?</h3>
<p>SQL has been around since 1974 and has become one of the most popular languages for managing relational databases. Its usefulness led to it becoming the standard language for the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">3) What are the usages of SQL?</h3>
<p>The primary function of SQL is to uphold the relational data and data structures within a database. Here are some typical applications of SQL:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>One way to interact with a database is by sending queries to it. These queries can be used to retrieve data, modify data, or perform other actions within the database.</li>
<li>To obtain information from a database.</li>
<li>To add data entries to a database.</li>
<li>To modify information contained in a database.</li>
<li>One way to remove data from a database is to delete records.</li>
<li>To generate fresh databases.</li>
<li>To generate fresh tables within a database.</li>
<li>One way to generate views within a database is by creating them through appropriate commands and syntax.</li>
<li>To carry out intricate tasks on the database.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">4) Does SQL support programming language features?</h3>
<p>SQL stands for Standard Query Language and is a command language designed for performing database operations such as manipulating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data within the database. Although it is categorized as a language, SQL does not support programming language functionalities such as loop, conditional statements, and logical operations. Its main function is to perform complex operations like joins on the data within the database.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">5) What are the subsets of SQL?</h3>
<p>There are four important components of SQL that can be classified as subsets.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>DDL, also known as data definition language, refers to a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and delete database structures such as tables, indexes, and schemas.</strong> It defines the data structure that consists of commands like CREATE, ALTER, DROP, etc.</li>
<li><strong>DML, which stands for Data Manipulation Language, is a language used to manipulate data stored in a database.</strong> It is used to manipulate existing data in the database. The commands in this category are SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Data control language (DCL) refers to a type of computer language that is used to control access to data stored in a database system. Its purpose is to maintain the security and integrity of the data, and it does this by allowing database administrators to set permissions and restrictions on who can access and modify the data. This helps to prevent unauthorized access or tampering with sensitive information.</strong> It controls access to the data stored in the database. The commands in this category include GRANT and REVOKE.</li>
<li><strong>Sure, I can help with that! Here's my rephrased version:

TCL, which stands for Transaction Control Language, refers to a set of commands used to manage transactions in a database. These commands are used to initiate and terminate transactions, as well as to control the changes made to a database during a transaction. In essence, TCL is a tool that database administrators use to ensure the consistency and accuracy of transactional data within a database.</strong> It is used to deal with the transaction operations in the database. The commands in this category are COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SET TRANSACTION, SAVEPOINT, etc.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">6) What is the purpose of DDL Language?</h3>
<p>DDL is an acronym for Data Definition Language. This term refers to a subcategory of a database that specifies the structure of the database when it's initially created. DDL is used to add, modify, or delete tables, indexes, schemas, views, sequences, and other database objects. It includes three main commands: CREATE, ALTER, and DELETE.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
CREATE TABLE Students
(
Roll_no INT,
Name VARCHAR(45),
Branch VARCHAR(30),
);
=======
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
CREATE TABLE Students
(
Roll_no INT,
Name VARCHAR(45),
Branch VARCHAR(30),
);
>>>>>>> 0f4472b14c27f664ee52ac33563d9bac0628389f
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">7) What is the purpose of DML Language?</h3>
<p>Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a set of commands that enable users to retrieve and manipulate data from a relational database. These commands are limited to read-only functions and cannot perform any alterations to the data. DML allows users to perform various operations on data stored in a database.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>One way to add data to a database is to utilize the INSERT command. This enables the user to input new information into the database.</li>
<li>One way to obtain information from a database is by using the SELECT command. This command allows users to retrieve specific data from a database based on certain criteria.</li>
<li>One way to modify information in a database is by using the UPDATE command. This command enables users to update existing records within the database.</li>
<li>To remove information from a database, use the DELETE command.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (111, 'George', 'Computer Science')
=======
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (111, 'George', 'Computer Science')
>>>>>>> 0f4472b14c27f664ee52ac33563d9bac0628389f
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">8) What is the purpose of DCL Language?</h3>
<p>Data control language is a crucial aspect of managing a database as it lets users control the access and permission management to the database. It is a subset of the database that determines which user can access which part of the database and at what time. The commands included in this subset are GRANT and REVOKE.</p>
<p>GRANT is a feature that allows system administrators to allocate privileges and roles to individual user accounts for performing designated tasks within the database.</p>
<p>The REVOKE command is a tool used by system administrators to withdraw privileges and roles from user accounts, thereby rendering them unable to exercise previously granted permissions within the database.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
GRANT * ON mydb.Student TO javatpoint@localhsot;
=======
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
GRANT * ON mydb.Student TO javatpoint@localhsot;
>>>>>>> 0f4472b14c27f664ee52ac33563d9bac0628389f
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">9) What are tables and fields in the database?</h3>
<p>A table is a format used to organize data into rows and columns. It provides an effective way of storing and displaying records in a structured manner. The concept is similar to worksheets in a spreadsheet application. Each row contains tuples which represent simple data items, while the columns identify the attributes of these items. The columns are arranged vertically, and the rows horizontally, facilitating easy categorization and storage of data.</p>
<p>Fields are an essential element in determining the structure of a table in a database. They are responsible for storing data in the same data type within a specific category. Although the number of rows can vary for each record, tables contain a fixed number of columns. Fields are often referred to as columns, and they represent the characteristics or features of the entity in each record.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Reword the following text to avoid plagiarism:

"Table: Student"</p>
<p>Here's a possible rephrased version:

Fields such as student roll number, name, date of birth, and branch are essential pieces of information to be collected for managing student data. These fields, along with others, are commonly used in educational institutions for various administrative purposes.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">10) What is a primary key?</h3>
<p>A primary key is a crucial field or a combination of fields in a table that serves as a unique identifier for each record. This special type of key ensures that there are no duplicate records and requires the associated column(s) to have unique values. It is mandatory for the primary key column to have non-null and non-empty values. A table can only have one primary key, but it can contain multiple unique keys. An example of a primary key is the student's ROLL number in a university or college setting.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/sql-interview-questions1.png" alt="SQL Interview Questions and Answers">
<p>One possible way to establish a primary key for a student table is by defining it in the following manner:</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
CREATE TABLE Student (  
    roll_number INT PRIMARY KEY,  
    name VARCHAR(45),   
);  
=======
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
CREATE TABLE Student (  
    roll_number INT PRIMARY KEY,  
    name VARCHAR(45),   
);  
>>>>>>> 0f4472b14c27f664ee52ac33563d9bac0628389f
</textarea></div>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">11) What is a foreign key?</h3>
<p>A foreign key is a type of key used to establish a relationship between two or more tables in a relational database. It is referred to as a referencing key and is designed to link tables by referencing the primary key of another table. This means that a field in one table will refer to the primary key of another table, enabling the identification of unique rows in the referred table and facilitating the maintenance of referential integrity. The relationship between primary keys and foreign keys is critical as it aids with ACID database properties and prevents actions that would jeopardize the relationships between parent and child tables.</p>
<p>One possible way to describe a foreign key in a table is by stating that it is a reference or connection between two tables, where the primary key of one table is used as an attribute in another table to establish a link between them.</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
CONSTRAINT constraint_name]  
    FOREIGN KEY [foreign_key_name] (col_name, ...)  
    REFERENCES parent_tbl_name (col_name,...)  
=======
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
CONSTRAINT constraint_name]  
    FOREIGN KEY [foreign_key_name] (col_name, ...)  
    REFERENCES parent_tbl_name (col_name,...)  
>>>>>>> 0f4472b14c27f664ee52ac33563d9bac0628389f
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<p>For additional details, please click on this link.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">12) What is a unique key?</h3>
<p>A unique key is a set of fields that guarantee the uniqueness of values stored in a column. This means that no two values in the column can be the same. It provides a way to ensure the integrity of a column or group of columns by preventing duplicate entries. For instance, in a student's table, the roll numbers and email addresses should be unique. Although a unique key can contain a null value, only one null value is allowed per column.</p>
<p>One possible way to describe a foreign key in a table is by stating that it is a reference or connection between two tables, where the primary key of one table is used as an attribute in another table to establish a link between them.</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
CREATE TABLE table_name(  
    col1 datatype,  
    col2 datatype UNIQUE,  
    ...  
);
=======
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
CREATE TABLE table_name(  
    col1 datatype,  
    col2 datatype UNIQUE,  
    ...  
);
>>>>>>> 0f4472b14c27f664ee52ac33563d9bac0628389f
</textarea></div>
<p>For additional details, please click on this link.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">13) What is the difference between a primary key and a unique key?</h3>
<p>Both primary key and unique key are constraints in SQL that serve important functions. The key difference between them is that while a primary key is used to identify each record in a table, a unique key is utilized to avoid the occurrence of duplicate entries in a column, except for NULL values. This can be further clarified through the following comparison chart:</p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>Primary Key</th>
<th>Unique Key</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The main purpose of a primary key is to provide a distinct identifier for every individual record within a given table.</td>
<td>A unique key serves as an exclusive identifier for data when the primary key is absent from a table.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It is not possible to save NULL values in the primary key field.</td>
<td>It is possible to save a NULL value in a column that has a unique key constraint, however, only a single NULL value can be stored in such a column.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It is not possible to alter or remove the values in the primary key column.</td>
<td>It is possible to alter the values in the column that serves as the unique key.</td>
</tr>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">14) What is a Database?</h3>
<p>A database is a well-organized collection of data that is structured into tables, rows, columns, and indexes. This electronic system is designed to facilitate easy access to information, manipulation, retrieval, storage, and management of data. Many organizations use databases to store their data because of their accessibility and operational ease. With a database, retrieving information and performing necessary tasks becomes effortless. It provides seamless access to relevant data, enabling users to perform their tasks with ease.</p>
<p>Here are the typical characteristics of a database:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Effectively handles vast quantities of information.</li>
<li>Accurate</li>
<li>Easy to update</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Data integrity</li>
<li>Simpler to investigate information.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">15) What is meant by DBMS?</h3>
<p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software application that acts as an intermediary between the user and the database. It provides extensive capabilities such as data organization, database engine, and schema management to streamline data manipulation through simple queries. Essentially, it serves as a file manager that manages data in the database instead of traditional file systems. Without DBMS, accessing data in the database would be much more complicated for users.</p>
<p>A list of the elements that make up a database management system include:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Software</li>
<li>Data</li>
<li>Procedures</li>
<li>Database Languages</li>
<li>Query Processor</li>
<li>Database Manager</li>
<li>Database Engine</li>
<li>Reporting</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">16) What are the different types of database management systems?</h3>
<p>There are various types of database management systems that can be classified according to their functions and features. Here are some of the significant classifications:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Hierarchical databases (DBMS)</li>
<li>Network databases (IDMS)</li>
<li>Relational databases (RDBMS</li>
<li>Object-oriented databases</li>
<li>Document databases, also known as Document DB, are a type of database that allows for the storage and retrieval of data in the form of documents. These databases are designed to work with unstructured and semi-structured data, making them ideal for storing large amounts of complex data. With Document DB, data can be stored in JSON or XML format, and can be queried using a variety of languages, including JavaScript and SQL. This makes Document DB a flexible and versatile choice for managing data in modern applications.</li>
<li>Graph databases</li>
<li>ER model databases</li>
<li>NoSQL databases</li> 
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">17) What is RDBMS?</h3>
<p>An RDBMS, or Relational Database Management System, is a type of database management system that is structured around the relational model. This type of system allows users to manipulate data stored in tables using relational operations. RDBMS software typically stores data in tables and links those tables through relational operators, providing users with a flexible and powerful way to access and manage their data. Some examples of RDBMS software solutions include Oracle Database, Microsoft Access, SQL Server, and MySQL.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">18) What is Normalization in a Database?</h3>
<p>Normalization is a method used for optimizing databases by reducing redundancy and dependency. It involves structuring the fields and tables in a way that eliminates unnecessary repetition of data.</p>
<p>Database normalization involves following specific guidelines commonly referred to as Normal Form. These guidelines consist of defined rules that assist in organizing data in a structured manner.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>First normal form(1NF)</li>
<li>Second normal form(2NF)</li>
<li>Third normal form(3NF)</li>
<li>Boyce-Codd normal form(BCNF)</li>
</ul>
<p>To eliminate redundancy, anomalies, and inconsistencies from a database, the following steps can be taken.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">19) What is the primary use of Normalization?</h3>
<p>Normalization is a technique used to make changes to a single table by adding, deleting or modifying fields. Its primary objective is to eliminate duplication, and minimize interruptions from inserting, deleting or updating data. Through normalization, a table is partitioned into smaller sections and linked using various associations to ensure redundancy is avoided.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">20) What are the disadvantages of not performing database Normalization?</h3>
<p>The primary drawbacks are:</p>
<p>When there are multiple instances of the same piece of data in a database, it results in the unnecessary consumption of disk space.</p>
<p>Inconsistency in a database can arise from redundant data entries or conflicting changes made to the database. When changes are made to one table but not reflected in others, data inconsistency can occur and compromise the overall consistency and reliability of the entire database system. This can have consequences for the system's overall functionality and integrity, potentially leading to maintenance issues and impacting its adherence to key ACID properties.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">21) What is an inconsistent dependency?</h3>
<p>Inconsistent dependencies occur when data is difficult to access due to a missing or broken path, making it challenging for users to retrieve the necessary information. This can lead to users searching for data in the wrong location, which can result in errors in the output.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">22) What is Denormalization in a Database?</h3>
<p>Denormalization is a strategy employed by database administrators to maximize the performance of their database system. It involves adding redundant data to a normalized database to simplify complex queries that involve merging data from multiple tables. The concept of denormalization is based on normalization, which refers to organizing a database into tables based on a specific purpose. By denormalizing a database, administrators can avoid intricacies associated with joins and other complex operations, which can lead to a more efficient database infrastructure.</p>
<p>Denormalization is a technique used in database optimization which involves adding redundant data to a normalized database structure for performance gains. It is important to note that denormalization does not replace normalization and is usually implemented after the normalization process has been completed.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">23) What are the different types of SQL operators?</h3>
<p>Operators are essential keywords or characters used for carrying out specific operations, including those in SQL queries. In SQL commands, operators are utilized mainly within the WHERE clause to filter data based on specific conditions. SQL operators fall into different categories, and their primary purpose is to facilitate data manipulation.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Arithmetic operators:</strong> These operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical data. The categories of this operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), remainder/modulus (%), etc.</li>
<li><strong>Logical operators:</strong> These operators evaluate the expressions and return their results in True or False. This operator includes ALL, AND, ANY, ISNULL, EXISTS, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, NOT, OR, UNIQUE.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison operators:</strong> These operators are used to perform comparisons of two values and check whether they are the same or not. It includes equal to (=), not equal to (!= or <>), less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal to (<=), greater than or equal to (>=), not less than (!<), not greater than (!>), etc.</li>
<li><strong>Bitwise operators:</strong> It is used to do bit manipulations between two expressions of integer type. It first performs conversion of integers into binary bits and then applied operators such as AND (& symbol), OR (|, ^), NOT (~), etc.</li>
<li><strong>Compound operators:</strong> These operators perform operations on a variable before setting the variable's result to the operation's result. It includes Add equals (+=), subtract equals (-=), multiply equals (*=), divide equals (/=), modulo equals (%=), etc.</li>
<li><strong>String operators:</strong> These operators are primarily used to perform concatenation and pattern matching of strings. It includes + (String concatenation), += (String concatenation assignment), % (Wildcard), [] (Character(s) matches), [^] (Character(s) not to match), _ (Wildcard match one character), etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3">24) What is a view in SQL?</h3>
<p>A view is a db object that serves as a virtual table and does not hold any data values. It only contains a subset of data from a table and appears like a regular table with rows and columns. However, since it's just a virtual table, it doesn't use up much space. A view can combine data from one or more tables and functions like a regular table without holding its data. Also, if changes happen in the underlying table, the same adjustments will occur in the view. Lastly, a view's name is unique.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/sql-interview-questions2.png" alt="SQL Interview Questions and Answers">
<p>Views serve as a vital tool in implementing a security mechanism for databases. They are searchable entities that function similarly to tables, allowing users to search for specific information. However, views are limited to showing only the data specified in the query used to create them, which ensures a level of data security.</p>
<p>Here's a possible rephrasing: 

To form a view, one can utilize the following format:</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column_lists FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
=======
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column_lists FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

<h3 class="h3">25) What is an Index in SQL?</h3>
<p>An index is a disk-related structure that enhances the speed at which rows can be retrieved from a table or view, resulting in a more efficient query with better performance. Its main purpose is to reduce the query's cost and, in turn, increase its performance by reducing the number of data pages that need to be accessed to locate a particular data page. Indexing provides a unique value that cannot be replicated, as it creates an entry for each value, allowing for faster data retrieval.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a book that contains information about different countries. If you wanted to learn about India specifically, would you waste your time going through every page of the book? Of course not! Instead, you would turn to the index to quickly find the page that focuses on India. This efficient method saves time and effort in finding the desired information.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">26) What are the different types of indexes in SQL?</h3>
<p>SQL indexes are used to reduce the cost of a query and improve performance. A high query cost means slower performance. There are various types of indexes that can be used in SQL for optimization.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Unique Index</li>
<li>Clustered Index</li>
<li>Non-Clustered Index</li>
<li>Bit-Map Index</li>
<li>Normal Index</li>
<li>Composite Index</li>
<li>B-Tree Index</li>
<li>Function-Based Index</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">27) What is the unique index?</h3>
<p>A UNIQUE INDEX is used to ensure that data in a table contains unique values in one or more columns. Multiple UNIQUE INDEXES can be created for a single table. It is important to check the data in the column before creating a unique index because these indexes are only applicable to columns with unique values. By enforcing unique values, duplicate entries are prevented from being entered into the indexed field. In some cases, a UNIQUE INDEX may automatically be created when defining a primary key.</p>
<p>Sure, here's a rephrased version: 

To construct this object, we can utilize the subsequent syntax:</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name  
ON table_name (index_column1, index_column2,...);
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
CREATE TABLE Employee(    
    ID int AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,     
    Name varchar(45),   
    Phone varchar(15),  
    City varchar(25), 
);
</textarea></div>
<p>To create a unique index for a Phone column, follow the following steps:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name_phone ON Employee (Phone);  
=======
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name  
ON table_name (index_column1, index_column2,...);
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
CREATE TABLE Employee(    
    ID int AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,     
    Name varchar(45),   
    Phone varchar(15),  
    City varchar(25), 
);
</textarea></div>
<p>To create a unique index for a Phone column, follow the following steps:</p>

<h3 class="h3">28) What is clustered index in SQL?</h3>
<p>A clustered index is a type of table that stores row data and is responsible for determining the order in which the data in the table is organized, based on the key values that are able to sort in one direction only. It is important to note that each table can only have one clustered index and it is automatically created when the primary key is generated. Clustered indexes are preferred when making numerous modifications to table data.</p>
<p>For additional details, please click on this link.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">29) What is the non-clustered index in SQL?</h3>
<p>Non-clustered indexes are indexes that are not the primary indexes (clustered indexes). Unlike clustered indexes, non-clustered indexes are created manually when multiple join conditions and various filters are used in a query. The data in a non-clustered index and the table data are stored separately and therefore cannot physically alter the table's order. Instead, it maintains logical order of the data within the table.</p>
<p>Non-clustered indexes are created for the purpose of searching data within a database. They operate like an index in a book, where the content is in one location and the index is in another. A table can have up to 249 non-clustered indexes. The use of non-clustered indexing can enhance the performance of queries that utilize keys without assigning a primary key.</p>

<h3 class="h3">37) What is INNER JOIN in SQL?</h3>
<p>Inner join is a type of database query that retrieves only the matching records based on the specified condition from two or more tables, while hiding the non-matching rows and columns. It is used to fetch rows where there is a match in at least one of the tables being queried. The INNER JOIN keyword is commonly used in this type of join, although it is not necessary to include the "INNER" keyword, as it is the default join type.</p>
<p>Here is an original version of the same content:

This type of join merges two tables into a new table based on a specified condition. The resulting table contains all the columns from both tables but only the rows that satisfy the condition. The inner join performs the intersection of the tables, meaning only the matching rows between the two tables are included in the result. This type of join is useful when you need to combine data from two tables that have a common field. A graphical representation of this join can be seen below.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/sql-interview-questions4.png" alt="SQL Interview Questions and Answers">
<p>Here's an example of how to use the INNER JOIN syntax:</p>

<h3 class="h3">38) What is the Right JOIN in SQL?</h3>
<p>The Right join fetches all rows from the right-hand table and only the rows from the other table that satisfy the join condition. It returns all rows from the right-hand table, even when there are no matches in the left-hand table. If there are unmatched records from the left-hand table, it produces a Null value. This join is commonly referred to as the Right Outer Join.</p>

<h3 class="h3">39) What is Left Join in SQL?</h3>
<p>The Left Join is a type of database operation used to retrieve the records from the left-hand table and any common records shared with the specified tables. This operation returns all rows from the left-hand side table, regardless of the existence of matching records in the right-hand side table. In case no match is found in the right-hand side table, the operation still returns the row but with null values. This type of join can also be referred to as a Left Outer Join.</p>

<h3 class="h3">41) What is a "TRIGGER" in SQL?</h3>
<p>In database management, a trigger is essentially a pre-written set of SQL instructions that is stored within the system catalog. Triggers are used to automatically initiate a batch of code in response to a specific event, such as when an insert, update, or delete command is executed on a given table. Because a trigger is essentially a set of activated actions for when data manipulation commands are given to the system, it is essentially a special type of stored procedure.</p>
<p>SQL triggers consist of two essential parts: events and actions. They work in conjunction whereby performing certain actions leads to an event being triggered as a result of those actions.</p>
<p>The CREATE TRIGGER statement is used in SQL to create triggers. To create a trigger, the syntax for this statement must be used.</p>

<h3 class="h3">42) What is self-join and what is the requirement of self-join?</h3>
<p>A SELF JOIN is employed to join a table with itself. This kind of join can be executed through the use of table aliases to avoid repeating the table name. Using the same table name more than once without table aliases in a single query will produce an error.</p>
<p>A SELF JOIN is necessary when merging data within the same table. This approach is particularly beneficial in transforming hierarchical data into a simpler structure.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how to use SELF JOIN in SQL:</p>

<h3 class="h3">43) What are the set operators in SQL?</h3>
<p>SQL set operators are utilized to merge data from tables of the same format. These operators enable the combination of rows from various queries, creating compound queries. It's crucial to note that the set operators differ from SQL joins, which combine columns from distinct tables. In SQL, there are four main types of set operators.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/sql-interview-questions10.jpg" alt="SQL Interview Questions and Answers">
<p>The UNION operator is utilized to merge the results of multiple SELECT queries into a single result set. One of its default features is to eliminate duplicate rows from tables. The following syntax demonstrates the use of the Union operator:</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
SELECT columns FROM table1  
UNION  
SELECT columns FROM table2;  
</textarea></div>
<p>Option B in SQL is known as the UNION ALL operator which works similarly to the Union operator. However, unlike the Union operator, UNION ALL does not eliminate duplicate rows from the output generated by the SELECT statements. The syntax for using the UNION ALL operator in SQL is as follows:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
SELECT columns FROM table1  
UNION  ALL
SELECT columns FROM table2;  
</textarea></div>
<p>The INTERSECT operator is used in SQL to retrieve common records from multiple SELECT statements. It ensures that unique records are returned and arranges them in ascending order by default. It is important to note that the number of columns and data types must be the same. The syntax for using the INTERSECT operator is as follows:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
SELECT columns FROM table1  
INTERSECT
SELECT columns FROM table2;  
</textarea></div>
<p>The MINUS operator is used in SQL to retrieve records from the first query that are not present in the second query. It eliminates duplicate values and is depicted in the syntax below:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
SELECT columns FROM table1  
MINUS
SELECT columns FROM table2;

<h3 class="h3">45) What is a constraint? Tell me about its various levels.</h3>
<p>The purpose of a constraint is to establish guidelines and regulations that determine which values or data can be stored in a table. It guarantees data accuracy and integrity within the table, by obliging us to store only appropriate information and restraining us from saving irrelevant information. A data action will fail if there is any inconsistency between the constraint and the action. Several constraints, such as NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT, and UNIQUE KEY, are commonly employed.</p>
<p>Here's an original rephrasing: 

Below is an example of how to add a constraint to a table:</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
CREATE TABLE table_name (  
    column1 datatype constraint,  
    column2 datatype constraint,

);  
>>>>>>> 0f4472b14c27f664ee52ac33563d9bac0628389f
</textarea></div>
<p>SQL provides two distinct levels for grouping constraints:</p>
<p>Column level constraints are limitations on the type of data that can be stored within a single column. These constraints only apply to the specific column and are designed to ensure data integrity.</p>
<p>Table Level Constraints refer to limitations that are imposed on an entire table and restrict the type of data that can be inputted.</p>

<h3 class="h3">49) What is the ACID property in a database?</h3>
<p>The ACID properties are designed to facilitate transactional processes comprising various tasks. These properties help maintain data consistency before and after a transaction in a database. Moreover, they guarantee that data transactions are handled efficiently and reliably in a database system. In other words, a transaction is a logical sequence of data operations that should comply with ACID properties for optimal results.</p>
<p>The ACID property is a set of characteristics that ensure reliability and consistency in database systems. The acronym stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.</p>
<p>Atomicity is a fundamental concept in database management. It guarantees that all statements or operations within a transaction will be executed successfully. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction will fail, and the database state will remain unchanged. This concept is implemented using several features such as COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and AUTO-COMMIT.</p>
<p>Consistency is a crucial property of a database system. It ensures that all validation rules are met before allowing changes to be made to the database. Simply put, the database remains in its original state unless the transaction is committed successfully. Consistency protects data from potential crashes and ensures that all data within the system remains valid and accurate.</p>
<p>The isolation property in database management systems refers to the ability of the transactional unit to operate independently and transparently from other executing statements. Its primary purpose is to regulate concurrency and prevent data corruption in a database. Essentially, it ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other, and their execution remains isolated from one another.</p>
<p>Durability is a crucial feature of a database system that ensures the committed transactions remain intact and permanent even in scenarios like power outages, system crashes, or other failures. This property guarantees the data's reliability, and users can retrieve it without fear of loss or corruption.</p>

<h3 class="h3">50) Is a blank space or zero the same as a NULL value?</h3>
<p>The NULL value is distinct from both blank spaces and zero. The distinctions can be explained as follows:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>A NULL value represents an absence of any value and can be used in situations where data is unavailable, unassigned, unknown or not applicable. Unlike zero, which is a number, and a blank space, which is treated as a character, we can perform arithmetic operations on NULL values.</li>
<li>The concept of NULL in database refers to an absence of a value, which cannot be treated as zero or blank spaces. While NULL can represent an unknown or missing value, it is distinct from other forms of non-existent data.</li>
<li>We can make a comparison between blank spaces and zeros against other blank spaces and zeros. However, we cannot guarantee that two NULL values will be the same since they signify the absence of data or the nonexistence of data.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">51) What are functions and their usage in SQL?</h3>
<p>SQL functions are commonly used code snippets within database systems for manipulating and processing data. These functions are responsible for performing specific tasks and can be thought of as measured values. It's important to keep in mind certain guidelines when creating functions.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>In order to properly define a function in programming, it is important to give it a name. Make sure that the name you choose does not start with special characters such as @, $, #, and others like them.</li>
<li>Functions are limited to being used with SELECT statements only.</li>
<li>When a function is executed, the code is compiled.</li>
<li>In programming, it is essential for functions to provide an output or a result.</li>
<li>A necessary aspect of using functions is providing input parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>SQL has two types of functions that are categorized based on their functionality.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>User-Defined Function:</strong> Functions created by a user based on their needs are termed user-defined functions.</li>
<li><strong>System Defined Function:</strong> Functions whose definition is defined by the system are termed system-defined functions. They are built-in database functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>SQL functions serve a variety of purposes, such as:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>To carry out mathematical operations on information.</li>
<li>To alter specific pieces of information.</li>
<li>To alter the result in a particular manner.</li>
<li>Rewritten: To properly display numerical values and dates in a visually consistent manner.</li>
<li>To change the type of data from one format to another.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3">52) What is meant by case manipulation functions? Explains its different types in SQL.</h3>
<p>Case manipulation functions are a type of character functions that allow for the conversion of data to uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case. This function can be used to format the output and can be applied in various parts of the SQL statement. It is particularly useful when searching for data and you are unsure of the case in which the data is stored.</p>
<p>In SQL, you can find three different functions for manipulating the case of text.</p>
<p>The LOWER function is utilized to transform a specified character into lowercase. For instance, when applied to the word "STEPHEN", it will output the word as "stephen."</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
SELECT LOWER ('STEPHEN') AS Case_Reault FROM dual;
</textarea></div>
<h4 class="n">NOTE: Here, 'dual' is a dummy table.</h4>
<p>The function "UPPER" is utilized to change a specified character to uppercase. This can be demonstrated through the example of converting the string "stephen" to uppercase, which results in "STEPHEN".</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
SELECT UPPER ('stephen') AS Case_Reault FROM dual;
</textarea></div>
<p>The INITCAP function is designed to convert characters to uppercase only at the beginning of each word, while the remaining characters are converted to lowercase. For instance, if you input "hello stephen," INITCAP would convert it to "Hello Stephen."</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
SELECT INITCAP ('hello stephen') AS Case_Reault FROM dual;
=======
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
SELECT LOWER ('STEPHEN') AS Case_Reault FROM dual;

<h3 class="h3">53) Explain character-manipulation functions? Explains its different types in SQL.</h3>
<p>Character-manipulation functions are designed to modify and extract information from a given character string. These functions can be used to manipulate individual characters or entire words, depending on the specific needs of the programmer. By passing a string or set of strings as input, the function can perform its specific operation and return the desired result.</p>
<p>Here are the functions used to manipulate characters in SQL:</p>
<p>ConCAT is a built-in function used in various programming languages to concatenate or join two or more strings together. Its purpose is to append one string to the end of another string. This function is helpful when there is a need to join different strings into a single one. For instance:</p>
<p>Rewritten: Create a string that combines the words "Information" and "technology" using the CONCAT function in a database system.</p>
<p>Information technology is a field that deals with the study, development, and application of computer systems and networks, including hardware, software, and telecommunications equipment. It covers a wide range of functions and services, such as data management, system administration, networking, programming, and cybersecurity. In today's digital age, information technology has become an integral part of almost every aspect of modern society, from business and finance to entertainment and education. As such, IT professionals are in high demand and can be found working in various industries, including healthcare, government, e-commerce, and telecommunications.</p>
<p>SUBSTR is a function that can be utilized to retrieve a designated portion of a string based upon an initial starting point and an endpoint. This can be useful for extracting specific information or data points from a larger string.</p>
<p>Rewritten: Retrieve a substring from the string 'Database Management System' starting at position 9 and with a length of 11 using the SELECT statement in SQL. This statement is executed on the DUAL table, which is a special one-row, one-column table in Oracle databases.</p>
<p>Rewritten: The field of business administration and oversight.</p>
<p>The LENGTH function is used to determine the numerical value of a string's length, including any spaces present in it. This allows you to easily measure the length of a string.</p>
<p>Rewritten: Determine the length of the string "Hello Javatpoint" using the SELECT statement on a database table called DUAL.</p>
<p>Rewritten: The answer is sixteen.</p>
<p>The INSTR function is used to locate the exact numerical position of a particular word or character within a string. It can be used to identify the location of a specific word or character within a given text. For instance,</p>
<p>How about this: 

Could you demonstrate the usage of the INSTR function with the following example query? 

SELECT INSTR ('Hello Javatpoint', 'Javatpoint');</p>
<p>Paraphrase:

The resulting answer to the given problem is seven.</p>
<p>This section is providing an explanation of the LPAD function. LPAD is a method in SQL that is used to return padding for a value that is right-justified and aligns the characters from the left side. A simple example of this would be...</p>
<p>Rewritten: A query was executed using the SQL function LPAD with the parameters '200', 6, and '*'.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but I cannot paraphrase the content without knowing what it is referring to or the actual original content. Please provide me with more information or the actual content so I can assist you better.</p>
<p>The content explains the function RPAD that is used to add padding characters at the end of a string in order to achieve a desired length. This function is especially useful for left-justified strings, and ensures that the final output is formatted correctly.</p>
<p>Reworded: 
An example SQL statement is presented where the RPAD function is used to add asterisks to the right side of the string '200' until it reaches a length of 6 characters. The statement is SELECT RPAD ('200', 6,'*').</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but I don't have any context or content to rephrase. Can you please provide me with the original content that needs to be paraphrased?</p>
<p>The TRIM function is a command that can eliminate specified characters from the start, end, or both sides of a text string. It can also remove excessive white space. A practical application of this function is to remove unwanted white spaces from the beginning or end of a string.</p>
<p>Modify this sentence in a way that presents the same meaning without using the same words: 

Rewrite: Alter the given statement to convey the intended message without copying the original phrasing.</p>
<p>The given input sequence is "ABBADCADBCA", and the desired output sequence is "BCDCB".</p>
<p>The replace function is utilized to substitute a specified string or substring with another string value. It replaces all occurrences of the specified text with the new text. An example of this is:</p>
<p>Rewritten: 

Modify the given statement by substituting the word "coffee" with "tea" using the REPLACE function. For example, "It is the best tea at the famous tea shop."</p>
<p>This tea is considered the top-rated beverage at the renowned tea store.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">54) What is the usage of the NVL() function?</h3>
<p>The NVL() function is a feature in Oracle databases that allows for the conversion of NULL values to other values. If the first parameter being checked is NULL, the function will return the value of the second parameter. On the other hand, if the first parameter is not NULL, the function does not change it. This function is not used in MySQL and SQL, but MySQL has the IFNULL() function while SQL server uses the ISNULL() function instead.</p>
<hr>

<h3 class="h3">57) How do we use the DISTINCT statement? What is its use?</h3>
<p>The DISTINCT keyword is utilized in SQL queries to retrieve only unique values for a specific column in a table. This keyword ensures that there are no duplicate values in the returned data set. It is used in conjunction with the SELECT statement and is written as "SELECT DISTINCT." This syntax is helpful in ensuring that data remains consistent and accurate throughout various queries and analyses.</p>

<p>Rewritten: The provided SQL query fails to return the expected output due to the incorrect use of the WHERE clause. To obtain the desired result, the HAVING clause should be used instead to restrict the groupings.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">60) What is the difference between the WHERE and HAVING clauses?</h3>
<p>The WHERE and HAVING clauses serve different purposes in SQL. The WHERE clause filters records before grouping, while the HAVING clause filters values derived from a specific group. In short, the WHERE clause is used to restrict the data retrieved by a query, whereas the HAVING clause filters the data after grouping. This distinction is important to understand when constructing SQL queries involving groups of data.</p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>WHERE</th>
<th>HAVING</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The implementation of this clause occurs through the use of row operations.</td>
<td>This statement is utilized in manipulating the columns of a dataset.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Using SQL WITH clause has a limitation in that it does not support working with aggregate functions.</td>
<td>Aggregate functions can be utilized in conjunction with this feature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You can utilize this provision in combination with the SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE instructions.</td>
<td>The usage of this clause is limited to the SELECT statement only.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>To gain further insight into dissimilarities, please refer to this link.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">61) How many Aggregate functions are available in SQL?</h3>
<p>An aggregate function is a useful tool in data analysis that calculates several metrics in a table and presents the result as a single value. These functions enable one to calculate values such as average, sum, minimum, and maximum among different groups of values in the table.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to utilize aggregate functions in a code syntax.</p>

<h3 class="h3">62) What is SQL Injection?</h3>
<p>SQL injection is a security weakness in the coding of websites and web applications. It enables hackers to manipulate back-end operations and gain access to private and confidential information by inserting harmful SQL statements into a database field. This enables hackers to control databases and carry out malicious activities. SQL injection is frequently deployed to extract sensitive data from databases and carry out administrative functions. It is often referred to as SQLi attack.</p>
<p>SQL injection is a common method of exploiting vulnerable databases by injecting malicious SQL code into input fields. This can enable an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or execute unauthorized operations on the database. Some typical examples of SQL injection attacks include injecting code through login or search forms, manipulating URL parameters, or through attack vectors like cross-site scripting (XSS).</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Modifying an SQL query to achieve the desired outcome by accessing confidential information.</li>
<li>There have been instances where Union attacks were deployed to retrieve data from various tables within databases.</li>
<li>Analyze the database to retrieve data about its organization and version.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3">63) What is the difference between the RANK() and DENSE_RANK() functions?</h3>
<p>In SQL, the RANK function assigns a rank to each row in an ordered partition within the result set. When multiple rows have identical values and are assigned the same rank, the next numerically higher rank will be determined by adding the number of duplicates to the previous rank value. For instance, if there are three records with rank 4, the next rank would be 7.</p>
<p>The function 'DENSE_RANK' assigns a distinct rank to each row in a partition based on the specified column value, without any gaps. It ensures consecutive ranking and if two or more rows receive the same rank, it assigns the same rank to them. The next rank assigned would always be the next sequential number. For instance, if there are three rows ranked at 4, the next rank listed would be 5.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">64) Is it possible to implicitly insert a row for the identity column?</h3>
<p>Certainly. It is possible to implicitly add a row for the identity column in a database. An example of how to do this can be given.</p>

<h3 class="h3">65) What are SQL comments?</h3>
<p>In SQL, comments are a way to annotate or explain queries in a manner that is easily understood by developers. They serve to simplify the SQL statement, making it more accessible for human readers. As the SQL code is parsed, comments are ignored. They can take the form of a single-line comment or span multiple lines.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Single Line Comments:</strong> It starts with two consecutive hyphens (--).</li>
<li><strong>Multi-line Comments:</strong> It starts with /* and ends with */.</li>
