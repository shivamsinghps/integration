<h2 id="React" class="h2padding">General React Interview Questions</h2>
<h3 class="h3">1) What is React?</h3>
<p>React is a popular open-source front-end JavaScript library designed by Facebook. It was created in 2011 with a focus on providing developers a declarative approach to building reusable UI components. React is used extensively in single page applications, enabling developers to create interactive view layers for web and mobile apps. It was developed by Jordan Walke, who was a software engineer at Facebook during that time and has since been employed in various products including WhatsApp and Instagram.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but without knowing the original content and to what extent it is plagiarized, I cannot provide a specific rephrased text. However, in general, to avoid plagiarism, one needs to express ideas and concepts in their own words while still crediting the original source.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">2) What are the features of React?</h3>
<p>React has become increasingly popular as a preferred framework for web developers. This is largely due to its notable features, including:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>JSX</li>
<li>Components</li>
<li>One-way Data Binding</li>
<li>Virtual DOM</li>
<li>Simplicity</li>
<li>Performance</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sorry, but without knowing the original content and to what extent it is plagiarized, I cannot provide a specific rephrased text. However, in general, to avoid plagiarism, one needs to express ideas and concepts in their own words while still crediting the original source.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">3) What are the most crucial advantages of using React?</h3>
<p>The subsequent list highlights the key benefits of utilizing React:</p>
<p><strong>React is a beginner-friendly and accessible framework that one can pick up without much difficulty. It is straightforward to use and can be adopted for various projects.</strong></p>
<p>React has a wide range of documentation, tutorials, and training materials available, making it a popular choice for developers. Switching from a JavaScript background to React is straightforward, with easy-to-understand resources available to get started. Even individuals with limited knowledge of JavaScript can begin creating web applications using React.</p>
<p><strong>The architecture used by React is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.</strong></p>
<p>React is a JavaScript library that belongs to the View element of the MVC architecture. It's commonly considered as one of the JavaScript frameworks, even though it's not as comprehensive as others. It's an open-source UI library that has several benefits, such as making tasks more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>React makes use of Virtual DOM to enhance its performance and efficiency.</strong></p>
<p>React is known for its high efficiency in rendering views, thanks to the use of virtual DOM technology. Instead of rendering directly on the actual browser DOM, React first creates a virtual representation of the DOM. This virtual DOM gets updated each time the data in the app changes. The use of virtual DOM provides faster performance compared to rendering directly on the actual browser DOM. This is because creating and updating the virtual DOM is much quicker. As a result, React apps are highly efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Constructing web applications that exhibit dynamic functionality is a straightforward process.</strong></p>
<p>React simplifies the process of developing a dynamic web application with increased functionality, requiring fewer codes. It employs JSX, a special syntax that enables rendering of specific subcomponents through HTML tag syntax and HTML quotes.</p>
<p><strong>React is SEO-friendly.</strong></p>
<p>React is a helpful tool for developers as it enables them to create user interfaces that are visually appealing and user-friendly across different search engines. Additionally, it provides a server-side rendering feature, which can improve the search engine optimization (SEO) of your application.</p>
<p><strong>React is capable of creating reusable components, which helps in efficient and faster development of web applications. The feature ensures that developers can reuse the same component in different parts of the application, saving time and energy while maintaining consistency.</strong></p>
<p>React-based web applications are composed of various components, each with their own set of controls and logic. These components generate a compact, reusable piece of HTML code that can be employed anywhere necessary. Because of their code reusability, these components simplify the process of developing and managing applications. Furthermore, they allow developers to construct intricate applications using basic building blocks and streamline the process of composing code. Reusing components also boosts the speed of the development process.</p>
<p><strong>Assistance provided by convenient utilities.</strong></p>
<p>React offers several useful tools that can help developers increase their productivity. These tools can be integrated with the Chrome and Firefox dev extensions, enabling us to inspect the React component hierarchies in the virtual DOM. This way, we can select specific components and analyze their current props and state, as well as make any necessary edits.</p>
<p><strong>React provides a wide range of robust libraries.</strong></p>
<p>The React framework has a vast array of libraries and enables you to select the tools, frameworks, and structure that are best suited for creating applications based on your specific needs.</p>
<p><strong>Possibilities for examining the codes.</strong></p>
<p>Testing and debugging code in React web applications is a straightforward process thanks to the use of built-in tools. This allows developers to ensure their code is functioning correctly and identify and fix any issues that arise.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but without knowing the original content and to what extent it is plagiarized, I cannot provide a specific rephrased text. However, in general, to avoid plagiarism, one needs to express ideas and concepts in their own words while still crediting the original source.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">4) What are the biggest limitations of React?</h3>
<p>The following outlines the major constraints of using React:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>React is a library that provides a set of pre-written code that helps developers create user interfaces (UIs). However, unlike a complete framework, React is not designed to provide all the necessary tools for building a complete application.</li>
<li>The library of this platform is vast and may require significant effort and time to fully comprehend.</li>
<li>It could pose a challenge for inexperienced programmers to comprehend and write the code.</li>
<li>React employs inline templating and JSX, which can present a challenge and serve as an obstacle. Additionally, these features can make the code more convoluted and harder to understand.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">5) What is JSX?</h3>
<p>JSX is an extension of React that integrates JavaScript and XML. It's designed to make HTML files more readable, and it enhances the performance and stability of React applications. In JSX, you can write XML-like expressions alongside JavaScript code in the same file, and these expressions are later compiled into regular JavaScript code by a preprocessor like Babel. As with HTML, JSX uses tags with names, attributes, and children.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return(
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello JavaTpoint&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    )
  }
}
</textarea></div>
<p>The given example utilizes JSX to render text within an HTML &lt;h1&gt; tag by returning a JavaScript function to the render function. Once compiled, the JSX expression is transformed into a standard JavaScript function.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello JavaTpoint");
</textarea></div>
<p>I'm sorry, but without knowing the original content and to what extent it is plagiarized, I cannot provide a specific rephrased text. However, in general, to avoid plagiarism, one needs to express ideas and concepts in their own words while still crediting the original source.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">6) Why can't browsers read JSX?</h3>
<p>In order to display JSX in a browser, it needs to be transformed into a JavaScript object first, as browsers can only understand JavaScript objects and not JSX. This can be done using transpilers such as Babel, which takes the JSX code and transpiles it into a format that the browser can read.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">7) Why we use JSX?</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>The reason WebAssembly is quicker than standard JavaScript is because it carries out optimization during the process of translating the code to JavaScript.</li>
<li>React employs a different approach to organizing technologies as opposed to the conventional method of keeping markup and logic separate in different files. Here, instead of maintaining a separation between markup and logic, React integrates both into its components.</li>
<li>TypeScript is a programming language that adds more features to JavaScript. It is designed to be type-safe, with most errors detectable during the compilation process.</li>
<li>This feature simplifies the process of generating templates.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">8) What do you understand by Virtual DOM?</h3>
<p>A Virtual DOM is a type of lightweight JavaScript object that acts as an intermediary between the rendering function and the displaying of elements on a web page. Essentially, it serves as an in-memory version of the real DOM and lists attributes, content, and other properties as objects. The render function creates a node tree of React components and updates it in response to various user or system actions.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">9) Explain the working of Virtual DOM.</h3>
<p>The process of Virtual DOM can be broken down into a three-step process.</p>
<p>In React, when there are changes to any data within the application, the entirety of the user interface is re-rendered in Virtual DOM form.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/react-interview-questions1.jpg" alt="React Interview Questions1">
<p>The next step involves determining the variance between the old and new DOM structures.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/react-interview-questions2.jpg" alt="React Interview Questions2">
<p>After performing calculations on the virtual DOM, the changes are only applied to the real DOM on the elements that have been modified.</p>

<h2 id="ReactComponent" class="h2padding">React Component Interview Questions</h2>
<h3 class="h3">14) What do you understand from "In React, everything is a component."</h3>
<p>React is a popular library for building web applications, where components play a significant role. These components break down the UI of a React application into small and independent pieces of code that can be reused. React renders each component individually, which avoids interfering with the rest of the application's UI. Therefore, every element in a React application is a component, and they are critical to the app's structure.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">15) Explain the purpose of render() in React.</h3>
<p>Every React component must contain a render() function. The purpose of this function is to display the HTML content you want to see on a component. If you want to show several HTML elements, they should be enclosed within a single parent tag like &lt;div&gt;, &lt;form&gt;, or &lt;group&gt;. The render() function will always produce the same output whenever it's called.</p>
<p>An example of displaying a heading could be illustrated by the following:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
import React from 'react'
 
class App extends React.Component {
   render (){
      return (
         &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
      )
   }
}
export default App
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Points to Note:</strong></p>

<h3 class="h3">16) How can you embed two or more components into one?</h3>
<p>There are various methods for embedding multiple components. One common approach is to combine two or more components in a specific format.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
import React from 'react'
 
class App extends React.Component {
   render (){
      return (
         &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
      )
   }
}
 
class Example extends React.Component {
   render (){
      return (
         &lt;h1&gt;Hello JavaTpoint&lt;/h1&gt;
      )
   }
}
export default App
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">17) What is Props?</h3>
<p>In React, Props refer to "Properties". They serve as inputs to components that cannot be modified. Props store the attribute values of a tag and function similarly to HTML attributes. They allow data to be transferred from the parent to child components throughout the app.</p>
<p>Props are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They function similar to arguments in a function, and are passed to the child component when it is called.</p>
<p>Props are a fundamental part of React. They are read-only and cannot be modified from inside the component. By adding attributes called props inside a component, we can use them to render dynamic data in our render method using this.props. Props allow for reusable components and dynamic rendering in React applications.</p>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">18) What is a State in React?</h3>
<p>The State in a react component is a fundamental component that contains its data and information, which can be modified during the component's existence in response to user or system actions. It serves as the driving force behind the component's behavior and rendering. To ensure the component's efficiency, the State should be kept as straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>Sure, I can help you with that. 

Let's make a component called "User" that has a state called "message".</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
import React from 'react'

class User extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">20) How can you update the State of a component?</h3>
<p>To modify the State of a component in React, we can make use of the setState() function. This function doesn't always replace the State immediately, but rather makes changes to the existing State. It's a crucial function that enables updates to the UI based on various events triggered by the user or server responses.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

class App extends React.Component {
   constructor() {
      super();

<h3 class="h3">22) What is arrow function in React? How is it used?</h3>
<p>The Arrow function is a recently-added feature in the ES6 standard. One of its advantages is that it eliminates the need to bind any event to 'this', as the scope of 'this' is not limited to any specific calling function. This means that when using arrow functions, there is no need to bind 'this' inside the constructor. The arrow function is sometimes referred to as a 'fat arrow' function.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
//General way
render() {    
    return(
        &lt;MyInput onChange={this.handleChange.bind(this) } /&gt;
    );
}
//With Arrow Function

<h3 class="h3">23) What is an event in React?</h3>
<p>An event refers to an occurrence that arises from a user's or system's activity, such as a mouse click, webpage loading, key pressing, or window resizing. React utilizes the same principles as DOM event handling systems. The Synthetic Event in React serves as a universal wrapper for the web browser's original event, providing cross-browser compatibility.</p>
<p>To handle events in React, there are certain differences in syntax that must be taken into consideration.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The naming convention for events in React follows camelCase instead of lowercase.</li>
<li>JSX allows for passing a function as the event handler instead of using a string, which was the traditional method.</li>
</ul>

class Display extends React.Component({    
    show(msgEvent) {
        // code   
    },

<h3 class="h3">25) What are synthetic events in React?</h3>
<p>A synthetic event refers to an object that works as a wrapper around the native event of the browser and ensures cross-browser compatibility. It creates a unified API that incorporates the functionality of various browser's native events, such as stopPropagation() and preventDefault().</p>
<p>Sure, here's a paraphrased version: 

In the provided instance, the event represented by 'e' is of a synthetic nature.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">

}
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">26) what is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?</h3>
<p>To avoid plagiarism, here's my rephrased version: 

Controlled and uncontrolled components are two types of components used in web programming. The main difference between them is that with controlled components, the component's state is managed by React, while with uncontrolled components, the state is managed by the browser.</p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>SN</th>
<th>Controlled</th>
<th>Uncontrolled</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>1.</strong></td>
<td>This means that it does not store any information or memory within itself.</td>
<td>The system remains in its current internal state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>2.</strong></td>
<td>In this scenario, the parent component has control over the data being utilized.</td>
<td>In this scenario, the DOM is in control of the data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>3.</strong></td>
<td>The statement means that a component in React can receive an existing value as a property.</td>
<td>The method employs a reference to access the present values.</td>

<h3 class="h3">27) Explain the Lists in React.</h3>
<p>In React, a list is an ordered display of data. The process of creating a list in React is similar to how it's done in JavaScript. Using the map() function, we can navigate through the list's elements.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
import React from 'react'; 
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; 

function NameList(props) {

<h3 class="h3">28) What is the significance of keys in React?</h3>
<p>A key is an important tool in React that enables the identification of items that have been added, removed, or updated in a given list. Its use is particularly valuable for dynamically created components and when users modify lists, allowing easy tracking of which components require re-rendering. Key usage can significantly boost application performance, enabling more efficient rendering by targeting only the relevant subset of items that require updating.</p>

<h3 class="h3">29) How are forms created in React?</h3>
<p>Forms play an essential role in enhancing user interaction and collecting relevant data. They can perform various functions such as verifying user authenticity, creating user profiles, searching and filtering data. Forms are comprised of various components including text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and buttons.</p>
<p>React provides a method of constructing forms that is stateful and responsive. The format of React forms is similar to that of traditional HTML forms but with some changes. React's state feature is modified only through the setState() function, and form submission is dealt with by a JavaScript function, which has the capacity to access all of the data entered into the form.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {value: ''};

      this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
      this.setState({value: event.target.value});

<h3 class="h3">30) What are the different phases of React component's lifecycle?</h3>
<p>The React component has various stages in its lifecycle that includes initialization, mounting, updating, and unmounting.</p>
<p>The Initial Phase in React marks the beginning of a component's lifecycle as it prepares to be rendered in the DOM. During this phase, the component is initialized with its default Props and State, which are set in the constructor of the component.</p>
<p>During the Mounting Phase, a component is instantiated and incorporated into the HTML DOM of the application.</p>
<p>The Update Phase is an important part of the React lifecycle that follows the Mounting Phase. It involves updating the component to display any changes made to its props or state. During this phase, React checks for any changes in props or state, and if there are any, it updates the component and re-renders it to display the latest version. This phase is repeated continuously as long as there are changes being made to the component's props or state.</p>
<p>The unmounting phase marks the end of the React lifecycle. At this point, the component instance is removed from the DOM after being destroyed.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but without knowing the original content and to what extent it is plagiarized, I cannot provide a specific rephrased text. However, in general, to avoid plagiarism, one needs to express ideas and concepts in their own words while still crediting the original source.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">31) Explain the lifecycle methods of React components in detail.</h3>
<p>Sure, here's a potential rephrasing:

The vital methods in the React lifecycle pertain to managing the various stages of a component's existence and behavior. These methods provide developers with a way to control how a component is created, updated, and destroyed, ensuring that it functions as intended. Understanding these methods is crucial for effectively working with React and producing high-quality applications.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>getInitialState():</strong> It is used to specify the default value of this.state. It is executed before the creation of the component.</li>
<li><strong>componentWillMount():</strong> It is executed before a component gets rendered into the DOM.</li>
<li><strong>componentDidMount():</strong> It is executed when the component gets rendered and placed on the DOM. Now, you can do any DOM querying operations.</li>
<li><strong>componentWillReceiveProps():</strong> It is invoked when a component receives new props from the parent class and before another render is called. If you want to update the State in response to prop changes, you should compare this.props and nextProps to perform State transition by using this.setState() method.</li>
<li><strong>shouldComponentUpdate():</strong> It is invoked when a component decides any changes/updation to the DOM and returns true or false value based on certain conditions. If this method returns true, the component will update. Otherwise, the component will skip the updating.</li>
<li><strong>componentWillUpdate():</strong> It is invoked before rendering takes place in the DOM. Here, you can't change the component State by invoking this.setState() method. It will not be called, if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.</li>
<li><strong>componentDidUpdate():</strong> It is invoked immediately after rendering takes place. In this method, you can put any code inside this which you want to execute once the updating occurs.</li>
<li><strong>componentWillUnmount():</strong> It is invoked immediately before a component is destroyed and unmounted permanently. It is used to clear up the memory spaces such as invalidating timers, event listener, canceling network requests, or cleaning up DOM elements. If a component instance is unmounted, you cannot mount it again.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">32) What are Pure Components?</h3>
<p>React introduced pure components in version 15.3, which included React.Component and React.PureComponent. These two types of components differ in their use of the shouldComponentUpdate() lifecycle method, which determines when a component should be re-rendered. In React.Component, shouldComponentUpdate() always returns true by default. In contrast, React.PureComponent compares changes in state or props and only renders a component when necessary. By simplifying the code and improving performance, pure components are a valuable addition to React.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">33) What are Higher Order Components(HOC)?</h3>
<p>React provides the Higher Order Component as a technique for reusing component logic that involves creating a function that accepts a component and returns a new one. This technique enables the compositional nature of React that allows for the creation of more advanced functionalities. It's worth noting that although it is not specifically a feature of React API, it's a pattern that emerges naturally from React's design.</p>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">34) What can you do with HOC?</h3>
<p>There are various functions and operations that can be performed using a Higher Order Component (HOC). Here are some examples of what you can do with HOCs:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Code Reusability</li>
<li>Props manipulation</li>
<li>State manipulation</li>
<li>Render highjacking</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">35) What is the difference between Element and Component?</h3>
<p>Elements and Components have several distinctions from one another in terms of their fundamental characteristics.</p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>SN</th>
<th>Element</th>
<th>Component</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>1.</strong></td>
<td>An element refers to a simple JavaScript object that defines the present status of a component and its associated DOM node, as well as the desired traits of the element.</td>
<td>A fundamental element of a React application is a component, which serves as the main building block. This can take the form of either a class or function that takes an input and generates a React element as output.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>2.</strong></td>
<td>The JSX does not contain any executable code. It simply provides details about the type of component, its properties, and any nested elements within it.</td>
<td>A React component is a reusable piece of code that defines elements of a user interface. It can hold data in its state and properties and can leverage the various lifecycle methods provided by React.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>3.</strong></td>
<td>It is immutable.</td>
<td>It is mutable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>4.</strong></td>
<td>It is not possible to utilize any techniques or operations on the elements.</td>
<td>Components can have various methods applied to them.</td>
</tr>

<h3 class="h3">36) How to write comments in React?</h3>
<p>In React, it is possible to create comments just like in JavaScript. There are two ways to achieve this.</p>
<p>The original content discusses how to write comments in a programming language. To avoid plagiarism, I would suggest the following rephrased content:

One way to add comments in a programming language is through single line comments, which can be written using forward slashes. Another way is through block comments, which are enclosed within curly braces and start with a forward slash and asterisk.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
{/* Single Line comment */}
</textarea></div>
<p>Sure, here's a rephrased version: 

In programming, comments are used to add explanations and context to code. There are two types of comments: single-line comments and multiline comments. Single-line comments are used for adding comments on a single line of code, while multiline comments are used for adding comments on multiple lines of code.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
{ /* 
   Multi
   line
   comment
*/ }  
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">37) Why is it necessary to start component names with a capital letter?</h3>
<p>In React, it's important to begin component names with a capital letter. Trying to start them with a lowercase letter will result in an error, since they'll be seen as undefined tags. The reason for this is that, in JSX, lowercase tags are viewed as HTML tags.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">38) What are fragments?</h3>
<p>React's version 16.2 introduced a feature called Fragments, which allows components to return multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM. Fragments provide a neat way to group a list of multiple children.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
render() {
  return (
    &lt;React.Fragment&gt;

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">39) Why are fragments better than container divs?</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>Fragments provide better performance and memory usage as they do not create additional DOM nodes, resulting in faster execution and lower resource consumption.</li>
<li>Certain CSS styling techniques such as CSS Grid and Flexbox involve a unique parent-child relationship that results in the insertion of additional &lt;div&gt; tags. This may create difficulties in maintaining the intended layout.</li>
<li>The DOM Inspector interface has been simplified, resulting in a less cluttered appearance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3">40) How to apply validation on props in React?</h3>
<p>Props validation is an essential resource that developers can use to prevent errors and difficulties in their code, thus enhancing its readability. In React, the PropTypes feature allows for efficient verification of the data types of property values passed through props, which is valuable in identifying potential bugs and ensuring optimal performance. Although not mandatory, defining components with propTypes can significantly improve the quality and reliability of the code.</p>
<p>In a React component, you can implement prop validation using App.propTypes. This helps to identify when certain props are passed with an incorrect data type, and issues warnings on the JavaScript console accordingly. After defining the validation patterns, you should also set the App.defaultProps.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
class App extends React.Component {
          render() {}
}
Component.propTypes = { /*Definition */};

<h3 class="h3">41) What is create-react-app?</h3>
<p>Create React App is a tool developed by Facebook that is used to build React applications. This tool allows for the creation of single-page React applications, and saves time by eliminating the need for manual setup and configuration of tools like Webpack and Babel. With create-react-app, starting a React project is as simple as running a single command.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
$ npx create-react-app my-app
</textarea></div>
<p>The command required to build a React app includes a variety of components. Some of the essential ingredients are listed below:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The platform facilitates support for React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax to provide users with an efficient development experience.</li>
<li>The libraries provided by Bootstrap enable the use of Autoprefixed CSS, which eliminates the need to manually add vendor prefixes such as -webkit-. This makes it easier for developers to create cross-browser compatible web pages.</li>
<li>The framework features a speedy and interactive testing tool which enables quick execution of unit tests while also providing coverage reports.</li>
<li>The tool features a development server that runs in real-time and provides users with notifications regarding common errors.</li>
<li>The project comes equipped with a scripting tool that can package JS, CSS, and images into a production-ready format complete with source maps and unique hashes.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">42) How can you create a component in React?</h3>
<p>React offers two methods to develop a component.</p>
<p>One way to create a component in React is through Function Components. These types of components are easy to implement and involve creating a pure JavaScript function that takes a props object as its first parameter and returns React elements.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
function Greeting({ message }) {
  return &lt;h1&gt;{`Hello, ${message}`}&lt;/h1&gt;
}
</textarea></div>
<p>The use of Class Components is a method in React that allows ES6 classes to define components. This is an alternative approach to the commonly used Function Component. It provides a more structured way of creating components and allows for more advanced features such as setting state and lifecycle methods. An example of how a function component can be rewritten using Class Components is provided.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return &lt;h1&gt;{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}&lt;/h1&gt;
  }
}
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">43) When do we prefer to use a class component over a function component? </h3>
<p>When deciding between using a class component or a function component in React, it's important to consider whether the component needs state or lifecycle methods. Class components are suitable for components that require these features, while function components can be used for those that don't. However, with the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, function components can now have access to state, lifecycle methods, and other features that were previously only available in class components.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">44) Is it possible for a web browser to read JSX directly? </h3>
<p>JSX is not directly readable by web browsers as they are designed to only read traditional JavaScript objects. As a result, web browsers cannot interpret JSX code without first converting it into a regular JavaScript object.</p>
<p>To enable a web browser to interpret a JSX file, it is necessary to convert the file into a standard JavaScript object. This conversion process is achieved using Babel.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">45) What do you understand by the state in React?</h3>
<p>React components have a state object that can contain information that changes during its lifecycle. It's advisable to keep the state of a component simple and minimize the number of components that have state.</p>
<p><strong>In the following steps, we will learn how to build a user component and incorporate message state into it.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
class User extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      message: 'Welcome to React world'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;{this.state.message}&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    )
  }
} 
</textarea></div>
<p>The state and props in React have similarities, but there are differences as well. The state is a private and controlled feature that can only be accessed within the component. The component owner has complete control over it and can choose to pass it on to other components at any time.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">46) What are the main changes that appear in React's ES6 syntax compared to ES5 syntax?/How different is React's ES6 syntax compared to ES5?</h3>
<p>The syntax differences between ES6 and ES5 can be easily observed. The following are some of the most noticeable ones.</p>
<h3 class="h4">require vs import</h3>

<h3 class="h3">47) What do you understand by props in React? </h3>
<p>React components receive input data called props that can be either single values or objects with multiple values. These props are created and named similarly to HTML tag attributes, and they are passed from parent components to their children.</p>
<p><strong>In React, props serve as a key component in enabling certain functionalities of a component.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>One way to customize your components is by passing custom data to them. This allows you to tailor the behavior and appearance of your components to meet your specific needs.</li>
<li>Trigger state changes.</li>
<li>To use a prop sent from a parent component to a child component in React, you can access it via `this.props.propName` within the child component's `render()` method.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's suppose we want to generate an element that has a property called reactProp.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
&lt;Element reactProp={'1'} /&gt;
</textarea></div>
<p>When using React, the reactProp name is added to the native props object of React library components. This means it becomes a property that can be accessed by the component.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
props.reactProp
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h2 id="ReactRefs" class="h2padding">React Refs Interview Questions</h2>
<h3 class="h3">48) What do you understand by refs in React?</h3>
<p>In React, there is an attribute called "refs" which is used as shorthand for references. It enables us to store references to specific DOM nodes or React elements. It provides a means of accessing and interacting with React DOM nodes or elements directly. The primary use case for "refs" is when we want to modify the value of a child component without relying on props.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but without knowing the original content and to what extent it is plagiarized, I cannot provide a specific rephrased text. However, in general, to avoid plagiarism, one needs to express ideas and concepts in their own words while still crediting the original source.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">49) How to create refs?</h3>
<p>One way to create a ref in React is by using the React.createRef() function and assigning it to a component's ref attribute. This allows you to reference and interact with the component throughout your code. It's common to assign the ref to an instance property when the component is first created.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.callRef = React.createRef();
  }
  render() {
    return &lt;div ref={this.callRef} /&gt;;
  }
}
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">50) What are Forward Refs?</h3>
<p>Ref forwarding is a technique that allows a reference to be passed from a parent component through to one of its child components. This technique is enabled through the use of the React.forwardRef() method and is commonly used with higher-order components and in reusable component libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';

const TextInput = React.forwardRef((props, ref) =&gt; (
  &lt;input type="text" placeholder="Hello World" ref={ref} /&gt;
));

const inputRef = React.createRef();

class CustomTextInput extends React.Component {
  handleSubmit = e =&gt; {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log(inputRef.current.value);
  };
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;form onSubmit={e =&gt; this.handleSubmit(e)}&gt;
          &lt;TextInput ref={inputRef} /&gt;
          &lt;button&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}
export default App;
</textarea></div>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">51) Which is the preferred option callback refs or findDOMNode()?</h3>
<p>Using callback refs is considered the more advantageous method compared to utilizing the findDOMNode() API. This is because callback refs offer a greater level of control when setting and unsetting refs, whereas findDOMNode() can limit future enhancements in React.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView()
  }
  render() {
    return &lt;div /&gt;
  }
}
</textarea></div>
<p>Here's a rephrased version: 
It is best to follow the suggested method, which involves careful consideration and adherence to guidelines.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.node.scrollIntoView()
  }
  render() {
    return &lt;div ref={node =&gt; this.node = node} /&gt;
  }
}
class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.node.scrollIntoView()
  }
  render() {
    return &lt;div ref={node =&gt; this.node = node} /&gt;
  }
}
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">52) What is the use of Refs?</h3>
<p>The Ref feature in React is employed when certain situations require the need for direct access to a DOM element or when a child component in a parent-child hierarchy needs to be accessed directly by the parent.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The purpose of the `ref` keyword is to obtain a reference to an element.</li>
<li>The Web API called Document Object Model (DOM) is utilized to manage focus, text selection, and media playback and obtain measurements related to the HTML document structure.</li>
<li>One common application of it is to initiate essential animations.</li>
<li>This method is employed in the process of integrating with external DOM libraries.</li>
<li>One possible way to rephrase the original content is:

Additionally, the "this" keyword in JavaScript can be utilized in various ways. For instance, it can be used to refer to the current object within a method or to access the properties and methods of an object. Furthermore, it can be employed in callbacks, where it can be passed as an argument or assigned to a variable to preserve its value.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sorry, but without knowing the original content and to what extent it is plagiarized, I cannot provide a specific rephrased text. However, in general, to avoid plagiarism, one needs to express ideas and concepts in their own words while still crediting the original source.</p>
<h2 id="ReactRouter" class="h2padding">React Router Interview Questions</h2>
<h3 class="h3">53) What is React Router?</h3>
<p>React Router is a popular routing library for React applications. It enables developers to easily create routes within their web applications, using the React Router Package. With React Router, developers can define multiple routes for their application, allowing users to access different parts of the app through unique URLs. This library helps to maintain structure and consistency in single page web applications, allowing users to navigate through the app seamlessly.</p>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">54) Why do we need a Router in React?</h3>
<p>React Router is a vital tool for displaying various views within a single-page application. It enables the definition of multiple routes within the app, redirecting the user to a specific route when they input a corresponding URL path into the browser. Therefore, by incorporating a Router library into the React application, we can create multiple routes, each leading to a distinct view.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
&lt;switch&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;React Router Example&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/" component={Home} /&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/about" component={About} /&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/contact" component={Contact} /&gt;
&lt;/switch&gt;
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">55) List down the advantages of React Router.</h3>
<p>React Router offers significant benefits that are worth considering. Below are some key advantages of using React Router:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>It is not required to manually configure the browser history in order to accomplish this task.</li>
<li>The Link component is a tool used for directing users to specific parts of an application by navigating internal links. It functions similarly to an anchor tag.</li>
<li>The rendering process of the product is accomplished using its Switch functionality.</li>
<li>The Router specifically requires one and only one child element.</li>
<li>The code specifies each component within the &lt;Route&gt; element.</li>
<li>The React framework has been divided into three packages: Web, Native, and Core. This segmentation helps to maintain its small size and allows for efficient use in various applications.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">56) How is React Router different from Conventional Routing?</h3>
<p>React Routing and Conventional Routing are two different approaches to manage routing in web applications. They have their own unique features that sets them apart.</p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>SN</th>
<th>Conventional Routing</th>
<th>React Routing</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>1.</strong></td>
<td>Conventional routing involves creating a separate file for each view.</td>
<td>React Routing utilizes a single HTML page for the entire application, as opposed to multiple pages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>2.</strong></td>
<td>When a user requests to access a web page, a HTTP request is sent to the server to retrieve the relevant HTML content.</td>
<td>The only aspect of the &lt;BrowserRouter&gt; attribute that is being altered is its History.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>3.</strong></td>
<td>This refers to a browsing experience in which the individual proceeds through various pages to access different views.</td>
<td>The user perceives they are browsing through multiple pages, but it's merely an illusion.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">57) Why you get "Router may have only one child element" warning?</h3>
<p>To solve the issue of multiple routes rendering at the same time, one needs to ensure that the routes are enclosed in either a &lt;Switch&gt; or &lt;div&gt; block, which exclusively renders a single route.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
render((
  &lt;Router&gt;
    &lt;Route {/* ... */} /&gt;
    &lt;Route {/* ... */} /&gt;
  &lt;/Router&gt;
)
</textarea></div>
<p>should be</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
render(
  &lt;Router&gt;
    &lt;Switch&gt;
      &lt;Route {/* ... */} /&gt;
      &lt;Route {/* ... */} /&gt;
    &lt;/Switch&gt;
  &lt;/Router&gt;
)
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">58) Why switch keyword used in React Router v4?</h3>
<p>The 'switch' keyword is a useful tool in displaying a singular Route out of multiple defined Routes. To achieve this, the &lt;Switch&gt; component is used. This component renders specific components based on matched paths and returns a not found component if the path is not matched.</p>
<h2 id="ReactStyling" class="h2padding">React Styling Interview Questions</h2>
<h3 class="h3">59) How to use styles in React?</h3>
<p>In a React application, we can utilize the style attribute to apply styles dynamically during rendering. This attribute allows us to use a JavaScript object instead of a CSS string, with properties written in camelCase. This is similar to accessing properties on DOM nodes through JavaScript. By using the style attribute, we can add styles to our components in a flexible and efficient way.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
const divStyle = {
  color: 'blue',
  backgroundImage: 'url(' + imgUrl + ')'
};

function HelloWorldComponent() {
  return &lt;div style={divStyle}&gt;Hello World!&lt;/div&gt;
}
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">60) How many ways can we style the React Component?</h3>
<p>There are four methods that can be used to customize the appearance of React components.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Inline Styling</li>
<li>CSS Stylesheet</li>
<li>CSS Module</li>
<li>Styled Components</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">61) Explain CSS Module styling in React.</h3>
<p>CSS Module is a CSS file that allows for local scoping of class and animation names by default. It is unique to the specific component importing it and cannot be applied to any other components without expressed permission. CSS Modules are created with a .module.css file extension.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but without knowing the original content and to what extent it is plagiarized, I cannot provide a specific rephrased text. However, in general, to avoid plagiarism, one needs to express ideas and concepts in their own words while still crediting the original source.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">62) What are Styled Components?</h3>
<p>Styled-Components is a tool designed for use with React, and it was created as an upgrade to CSS Modules. This library allows users to use enhanced CSS to style the component systems in their React application. By using a combination of JavaScript and CSS, users can apply unique styles to each component, and those styles will not apply to any other elements on the page. The scope of styled-components is kept within a single component, ensuring that no unwanted leaks occur.</p>
<p>The styled-components provides:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Automatic critical CSS</li>
<li>There are no issues with the names of the classes.</li>
<li>Simplifying the process of removing CSS.</li>
<li>Simple dynamic styling</li>
<li>Painless maintenance</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">63) What are hooks in React? </h3>
<p>React introduced a new feature called Hooks in version 16.8, which allows developers to use state and other React features without having to write a class.</p>
<p><strong>Here's an example of how to use the useState hook:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
import { useState } from 'react';
function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You clicked {count} times&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;
        Click on this button
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">64) What are the rules you should follow for the hooks in React? </h3>
<p>To properly use hooks in React, there are a couple of rules that we need to follow.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>It's important to remember to only call hooks at the top level of your React functions and not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. This maintains the order of hook calls with each component render and preserves the state of hooks between multiple calls to functions like useState and useEffect.</li>
<li>It's important to only use hooks in React functions and not in regular JavaScript functions. Avoid calling hooks in non-React functions.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">65) What are forms in React? </h3>
<p>React utilizes forms to allow users to interact with web applications effectively. Here are some of the primary functions of forms used in React:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Forms allow for an interactive communication between users and the application. They offer a means for users to input and exchange information with the application whenever necessary.</li>
<li>Forms are an essential component of an interactive and aesthetically appealing application. They consist of various elements, such as buttons, text fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons, that enhance the application's usability and design.</li>
<li>Using forms is considered to be the optimal method of gathering information from users.</li>
<li>Forms serve several purposes, including but not limited to user authentication, search functionality, filtering data, and indexing.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">66) What is an error boundary or error boundaries?</h3>
<p>In React version 16, a new feature called error boundary was introduced. This allows developers to detect errors that occur during the render phase. A component that uses certain lifecycle methods is considered an error boundary, and can catch errors at specific points during execution.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Render phase</li>
<li>Reworded: In a method that is part of an object's lifecycle...</li>
<li>Inside the constructor</li>
</ul>

If an error occurs in a React application, it can crash the entire app. This is where error boundaries come in handy. They are components that catch errors anywhere within their child component tree and display a fallback UI instead of the erroneous component tree. However, if error boundaries are not implemented, the app may suffer from unexpected crashing.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
class CounterComponent extends React.Component{
 constructor(props){
   super(props);
   this.state = {
     counterValue: 0
   }
   this.incrementCounter = this.incrementCounter.bind(this);
 }
 incrementCounter(){
   this.setState(prevState =&gt; counterValue = prevState+1);
 }
 render(){
   if(this.state.counter === 2){
     throw new Error('Crashed');
   }
   return(
     &lt;div&gt;
       &lt;button onClick={this.incrementCounter}&gt;Increment Value&lt;/button&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;Value of counter: {this.state.counterValue}&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
   )
 }
}
</textarea></div>
<p>In the given example code, an error is caused inside the render method when the counterValue is equal to 2. Errors inside the render method result in the component being unmounted, which can be problematic if we want to display the error to the user. To handle this, we can use error boundaries, which enable us to display an error message to the user without the component being unmounted. Without an error boundary, the user would simply see a blank page if an error occurred inside the render method.</p>
<p>With error boundaries:</p>
<p>As previously stated, an error boundary is a component that utilizes one or both of the listed approaches:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>static getDerivedStateFromError</li>
<li>componentDidCatch</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following example demonstrates how to implement an error boundary to handle errors that occur during the rendering phase of a React component.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
 constructor(props) {
   super(props);
   this.state = { hasError: false };
 }
 static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {     
   return { hasError: true }; 
 }
  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {       
   logErrorToMyService(error, errorInfo); 
 }
 render() {
   if (this.state.hasError) {     
     return &lt;h4&gt;Something went wrong&lt;/h4&gt;     
   }
   return this.props.children;
 }
}
</textarea></div>
<p>In the given code snippet, the getDerivedStateFromError function is responsible for displaying the alternative UI when a render method encounters an error.</p>
<p>The componentDidCatch function records details of the error to an error tracking platform.</p>
<p>We can render the CounterComponent with the assistance of error boundary to handle errors.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
&lt;ErrorBoundary&gt;
  &lt;CounterComponent/&gt;
&lt;/ErrorBoundary&gt;
</textarea></div>

<h3 class="h3">67) In which cases do error boundaries not catch errors?</h3>
<p>There are certain scenarios where error boundaries are not effective in catching errors.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Errors within event handlers cannot be caught by error boundaries.</li>
<li>While rendering content on the server-side, certain processes take place.</li>
<li>If an error is encountered within the error boundary code itself, the program may face difficulties.</li>
<li>One way to write asynchronous code is to use callbacks such as setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame. These allow for the execution of code to be delayed, allowing other tasks to be processed in the meantime.</li>

<h3 class="h3">68) What were the major problems with MVC framework?</h3>
<p>There are certain issues associated with the use of the MVC framework.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Performing DOM manipulation was a resource-intensive task.</li>
<li>When an application has excessive amounts of unoptimized code, it can cause the application to operate slowly and inefficiently.</li>
<li>The memory usage was excessive, resulting in significant wastage.</li>

<h3 class="h3">69) Explain the Flux concept.</h3>
<p>Flux is a unique application architecture employed by Facebook in the creation of its client-side web application that incorporates React. It is not a framework or a library, but rather an architecture that complements React as a view. The architecture follows the Unidirectional Data Flow model and is particularly helpful in projects requiring dynamic data that needs constant and efficient updating.</p>

<h3 class="h3">70) What is Redux?</h3>
<p>Redux is a JavaScript library that is utilized to control and manage app state. It works perfectly with React for constructing user interfaces. An advantage of Redux is that it provides consistency across different environments and is easy to test. It was created by Andrew Clark and Dan Abramov in 2015.</p>
<p>React Redux is a library that connects React and Redux, allowing React components to access data from a Redux Store and update that data by dispatching actions. Redux is a state management tool that enables developers to handle complex applications by managing state changes through a unidirectional data flow pattern. React Redux provides an easy-to-understand way for components to stay in sync with the store and re-render when the relevant data changes. This makes it an efficient solution for building scalable applications.</p>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">71) What are the three principles that Redux follows?</h3>
<p>Redux adheres to three guiding principles.</p>
<ol class="points">
<li><strong>Rewritten: A "single source of truth" is a concept that refers to the idea of having one central point of information that serves as the authoritative reference for something. It is the go-to source that ensures consistency and accuracy across an organization, meaning that any information shared or used can be trusted to be correct.</strong> The State of your entire application is stored in an object/state tree inside a single Store. The single State tree makes it easier to keep changes over time. It also makes it easier to debug or inspect the application.</li>
<li><strong>The system's State is set to be unalterable and only allows for viewing without the possibility of modification.</strong> There is only one way to change the State is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This principle ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks can write directly to the State.</li>
<li><strong>The process of making modifications to data in programming is carried out through the use of pure functions.</strong> To specify how actions transform the state tree, you need to write reducers (pure functions). Pure functions take the previous State and Action as a parameter and return a new State.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">72) List down the components of Redux.</h3>
<p>Redux is made up of various building blocks that work together to form a predictable and maintainable state management system. These components are essential for the efficient functioning of Redux.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>STORE:</strong> A Store is a place where the entire State of your application lists. It is like a brain responsible for all moving parts in Redux.</li>
<li><strong>ACTION:</strong> It is an object which describes what happened.</li>
<li><strong>REDUCER:</strong> It determines how the State will change.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sorry, but without knowing the original content and to what extent it is plagiarized, I cannot provide a specific rephrased text. However, in general, to avoid plagiarism, one needs to express ideas and concepts in their own words while still crediting the original source.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">73) Explain the role of Reducer.</h3>
<p>Reducers are responsible for handling the payloads of actions and updating the Store by modifying the State accordingly. They perform this task by utilizing pure functions that return a new State from the pre-existing one. If no changes are necessary, the previous State is returned as is.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">74) What is the significance of Store in Redux?</h3>
<p>A Store is a crucial component of the Redux architecture. It serves as a container for the application's State and offers methods to access the State, send out Actions, and register listeners through subscribe(listener). The Store holds the State of the entire application in a single tree structure, which simplifies the management of information and ensures predictability. Middleware can be appended to the Store to manage data processing and create a log of all actions that modify the Store's State. Reducers generate new state objects as the result of actions.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">75) How is Redux different from Flux?</h3>
<p>The Redux and Flux have differences.</p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>SN</th>
<th>Redux</th>
<th>Flux</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>1.</strong></td>
<td>Redux is a free-to-use JavaScript library employed for the purpose of managing the state of an application.</td>
<td>Flux is a design pattern that is used in conjunction with React for building applications. It is not a library or framework but rather an architecture that follows the Unidirectional Data Flow model.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>2.</strong></td>
<td>The state of a store cannot be changed, making it immutable.</td>
<td>It is possible to modify the state of a Store.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>3.</strong></td>
<td>The approach used in this context emphasizes the separation of store and change logic.</td>
<td>This means that the Store holds both the current state of the application and the necessary logic for changing that state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>4.</strong></td>
<td>There is only one store associated with it.</td> 
<td>The content states that a business entity can have several store locations. To avoid plagiarism, one could say: "It is possible for a company to operate in multiple physical locations, often referred to as stores."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>5.</strong></td>
<td>The concept of a Dispatcher is not present in Redux.</td>
<td>The system operates with a solitary Dispatcher, and all operations are routed through this one entity.</td>
</tr>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">76) What are the advantages of Redux?</h3>
<p>React Redux boasts several key benefits that set it apart from other options.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>React Redux is a set of user interface bindings for React applications that enables developers to handle state and efficiently manage their components. These bindings are consistently updated to ensure that React components function as expected with any changes in the API.</li>
<li>The use of Redux in a React application promotes the development of sound architectural design.</li>
<li>React has numerous built-in performance optimizations that enable components to only re-render when necessary, resulting in improved performance. These internal optimizations are designed to ensure that the application runs as efficiently as possible.</li>
<li>Reworded: One benefit of using comments in code is that it simplifies the process of maintaining the code.</li>
<li>Redux utilizes small, pure, and isolated functions in its codebase which increases the testability and independence of the code.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">77) How to access the Redux store outside a component?</h3>
<p>To properly export a Store created through the createStore() method, it is important to export it from the module where it was initially created. Additionally, it is crucial to avoid polluting the global window space.</p>

<p class="pq">Reconciliation in React refers to the process of comparing the current state of a component with its previous state when there are changes to be made. It involves determining what has changed in the component and updating only that part of the component instead of rendering the entire component. This process helps to optimize the performance of React applications by reducing unnecessary re-renders and updates.</p>
<ol class="pointsa">
<li>The process of Reconciliation in React is responsible for updating the Document Object Model (DOM).</li>
<li>The Reconciliation process is a mechanism in React that involves the removal of the DOM.</li>
<li>The Reconciliation process refers to the way React handles component updates and deletions. It is an essential part of React's lifecycle and ensures that any necessary changes to a component are efficiently and accurately applied.</li>

<p class="pq">Can you identify the accurate phases of the component lifecycle from the options provided?</p>
<ol class="pointsa">
<li>Here's a rephrased version of the content:

For mounting a component in React, you can use the lifecycle method "getDerivedStateFromProps()". For updating a component, the method "componentWillUnmount()" can be used. Lastly, for unmounting a component, the method "shouldComponentUpdate()" can be used.</li>
<li>The lifecycle methods in React provide useful hooks for developers to run code at different points in a component's lifecycle. The componentWillUnmount method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM, the render method is called whenever a component's state or props are changed, and the setState method is used to update a component's state. These methods can be used to ensure that a component behaves correctly throughout its lifespan.</li>
<li>The lifecycle methods in React can be categorized into three categories: mounting, updating, and unmounting. The componentDidMount() method is used for mounting, componentDidUpdate() is used for updating, and componentWillUnmount() is used for unmounting.</li>
<li>This passage discusses the methods used in React regarding the mounting, updating, and unmounting of components. The constructor method is utilized for mounting, while the getDerivedStateFromProps method is implemented for updating. Finally, the render method is employed for unmounting.</li>
