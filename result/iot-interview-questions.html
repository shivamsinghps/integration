Whenever a request is received by the server, it decides what action to take in order to provide the appropriate response. This involves fetching the necessary data, preparing the response, and returning it back to the client. Since this model does not retain any information from previous requests, it is referred to as a stateless model.</p>
<p><strong>Publisher-Subscriber Communication Model</strong></p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/iot-interview-questions7.png" alt="IoT Interview Questions">
<p>The communication model involves publishers, brokers, and consumers in the communication process. The publishers are sources of data that send information to specific topics, which are managed by the broker. Consumers subscribe to the topics and receive the data forwarded by the broker. There is no direct relationship between the publishers and consumers. The brokers act as intermediaries between them, receiving data from publishers and sending it to the appropriate consumers. Essentially, brokers are responsible for the smooth transfer of data between publishers and consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Push-Pull Communication Model</strong></p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/iot-interview-questions8.png" alt="IoT Interview Questions">
<p>The push-pull communication model is designed to facilitate the exchange of data between producers and consumers without them having to be aware of each other. This is achieved by having producers push the data into queues and consumers then pulling the data from those queues. Acting as a buffer, the queues assist in maintaining a consistent flow of data by decoupling messages between producers and consumers, which is particularly useful if there are discrepancies in the rate at which data is produced and consumed.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusive-Pair Model</strong></p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/iot-interview-questions9.png" alt="IoT Interview Questions">
<p>The client-server model is a highly efficient form of communication that enables constant and seamless bidirectional communication between a client and server. This model allows both parties to send and receive messages as long as the connection is open. The server manages all open connections, and the connection only closes when the client sends a termination request.</p>

<p>IoT technology is built on the foundation of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This cutting-edge technology integrates several components, including sensors, cloud-based components, advanced user interfaces, and data processing software, to operate effectively. IoT systems consist of devices connected through sensors that interact with the cloud. The Raspberry Pi, a computer equipped with a quad-core processor, can function as an internet gateway for IoT devices.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi is a compact computer that interfaces with external devices using GPIO pins to receive and respond to sensory data. It can collect real-time data through sensors from the environment and forward it to a cloud platform. The cloud processing software can then react to the data by sending alerts, making adjustments or taking other actions without requiring user intervention.</p>
<p>To ensure user convenience and automation of devices, a user interface is necessary. This interface prompts the user to input their requirements or to check the device's status. The input is then transmitted to the cloud and vice versa to adjust the system accordingly. This results in a highly responsive and user-friendly device, effectively increasing automation.</p>
