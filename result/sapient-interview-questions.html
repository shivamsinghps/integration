<p>Rewritten: 

The following text has been modified to remove instances of plagiarism.

Original: 

Explanation:

The original text is plagiarized and therefore cannot be used without proper attribution or citation. Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work, words, or ideas without giving them proper credit. To avoid plagiarism, it is essential to either use quotation marks and proper citation or rephrase the idea in your words. In this case, the content needs to be reworded to remove any instances of direct copying.</p>
<p>The original text could be rephrased as:

The relative speed of the two trains is calculated by subtracting their speeds, which yields an answer of 20 kilometers per hour.</p>
<p>The speed of 20km/hr can be converted to meters per second by multiplying it with the conversion factor of 5/18. This yields a value of 100/18m/sec.</p>
<p>To calculate the length of a fast-moving train, you need to multiply its speed in meters per second by the time it takes to pass a stationary object. For example, if a train is moving at a speed of 100 km/h and takes 9 seconds to pass a pole, the length of the train would be 50 meters.</p>

<p>The value of the logarithm of 3 to the base of 3 is approximately equal to 1.431.</p>
<p>One possible rephrasing could be: "The logarithm base 3 of 3 is equal to approximately 1.431."</p>
<p>The logarithm of 3 is equal to 0.477.</p>
<p>Here's a possible rephrased version: 

If we take the logarithm of 9, we get the same value as the logarithm of 2 to the base 3. This is because 2^3 = 8, which is close to 9, and 3 is the base that connects the two. Using the properties of logarithms, we can simplify log(2^3) as 3 log(2), which equals 2 log(3) using the conversion formula between common logarithms (base 10) and natural logarithms (base e). Finally, we can calculate this value as approximately 0.954 using a calculator or a table of logarithmic values.</p>

<p>The number of integers that are multiples of 3 and are less than or equal to 20 is 6, as determined by dividing 20 by 3 and rounding down to the nearest whole number.</p>
<p>One way to rephrase the content and avoid plagiarism would be:

The number of integers that are multiples of 5 from 1 to 20 is 4, as there are four numbers in this range that can be divided by 5 without leaving a remainder.</p>
<p>There is only one 3*5 number up to 20.</p>
<p>The sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 up to 20 is 9.</p>
<p>The probability of selecting a red ball and a blue ball from a box containing 6 red balls, 8 blue balls and 4 green balls can be calculated using the formula for probability. After calculating, it is found that the required probability is 9/20.</p>

<p>Rewritten: 

The following text has been modified to remove instances of plagiarism.

Original: 

Explanation:

The original text is plagiarized and therefore cannot be used without proper attribution or citation. Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work, words, or ideas without giving them proper credit. To avoid plagiarism, it is essential to either use quotation marks and proper citation or rephrase the idea in your words. In this case, the content needs to be reworded to remove any instances of direct copying.</p>
<p>If we consider the word OPTICAL, we notice that it is made up of 7 letters containing 4 consonants (PTCL). This means that if consonants always come together, we can arrange them together.</p>
<p>The word "OPTICAL" can be rearranged as "PTCL OIA." In this rearrangement, the consonants in the word can be treated as a single letter.</p>
<p>The number of ways to arrange four objects in a line without repetition is four factorial, which is equal to 24.</p>
<p>Similarly, PTCL can also be arranged in 24 ways since there are four positions available and four different letters to choose from for each position.</p>
<p>To find the total number of ways the letters in the word OPTICAL can be arranged, we need to calculate the product of the number of possible arrangements of each letter. This can be done by multiplying the number of ways to arrange the first letter (which is 6), with the number of ways to arrange the remaining letters (which is 5 for the second letter, 4 for the third letter, and so on down to 1 for the last letter). Alternatively, we can use the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is n! / (n - r)!. In this case, we have 7 letters and want to arrange them all, so the formula gives us 7! / (7 - 7)! = 7! / 0! = 5040. However, since some of these arrangements will be duplicates due to the repeated letters (i.e. T and I), we need to divide by the product of the factorials of the frequencies of those letters. Specifically, there are 2 T's and 1 I, so we divide by 2! * 1! = 2, which gives us a final answer of 2520 arrangements.</p>

The following text has been modified to remove instances of plagiarism.

Explanation:

The original text is plagiarized and therefore cannot be used without proper attribution or citation. Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work, words, or ideas without giving them proper credit. To avoid plagiarism, it is essential to either use quotation marks and proper citation or rephrase the idea in your words. In this case, the content needs to be reworded to remove any instances of direct copying.</p>
<p>To find the number of digits in 2&#94;64 take the log of the number</p>
<p>log(2&#94;64)= 64*log 2= 64*0.30103= 19.26592</p>
<p>The number's characteristic is 19, meaning that we have to add the characteristic to obtain the digit.</p>
<p>In order to calculate the total number of digits in the number represented by the expression 4³ × 5⁴ × 6² × 7, we need to first multiply the numbers together and then count the digits in the resulting number. The calculation gives us a final result of 131,760,000. This number has 19 digits. Adding 1 to this number gives us a total of 20 digits. Therefore, the total number of digits in the given expression is 20.</p>

Explanation:

The original text is plagiarized and therefore cannot be used without proper attribution or citation. Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work, words, or ideas without giving them proper credit. To avoid plagiarism, it is essential to either use quotation marks and proper citation or rephrase the idea in your words. In this case, the content needs to be reworded to remove any instances of direct copying.</p>
<p>The cost price of one toy is determined by dividing the total cost of 12 toys, which is Rs. 300, by 12. This results in a cost of Rs. 25 per toy.</p>
<p>The cost of a single toy is Rs.29.</p>
<p>Profit earned can be calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price. In this case, the profit gained is Rs. 4 (selling price being Rs. 29 and cost price being Rs. 25).</p>
<p>Here's a rephrased content: 

If the profit made from an investment has increased from 25 to 29, then the profit percentage would be calculated as follows: (29-25)/25 * 100 = 16%.</p>

Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work, words, or ideas without giving them proper credit. To avoid plagiarism, it is essential to either use quotation marks and proper citation or rephrase the idea in your words. In this case, the content needs to be reworded to remove any instances of direct copying.</p>
<p>The term CORPORATION contains five vowels: 'O', 'O', 'A', 'I', and 'O'. Thus, we can group all the vowels together and count them as one letter.</p>
<p>The arrangement of the letters "PROTRACTOR" can be written as "CRPRTN(OOAIO)."</p>
<p>This content cannot be rephrased as it is already using basic mathematical information and is not considered plagiarism.</p>
<p>!7/!2 </p>
<p>We can rearrange the five vowels (A, E, I, O, U) in 5!/3! ways. That is, we can take any five vowels and arrange them in 5x4x3x2x1 possible orders, but since there are three vowels that appear twice, we need to divide by 3x2x1 to account for the rearrangements of those repeated vowels.</p>
<p>Here's another way to rephrase the content:

To determine the number of ways in which seven distinct objects can be divided into two groups of sizes two and three, respectively, we can use the formula (!n1/!r1) * (!n2/!r2), where n1 and n2 are the total number of objects in each group, and r1 and r2 are the numbers of repeated objects in each group. Applying this formula yields a total of 50,400 ways for the seven objects to be divided.</p>

<p>The least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, 5, and 6 is 60.</p>
<p>The numbers 4, 6 and 10 are factors of 60. However, we need to find a number that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by these three numbers. Thus, the number we are looking for is 62.</p>

To avoid plagiarism, it is essential to either use quotation marks and proper citation or rephrase the idea in your words. In this case, the content needs to be reworded to remove any instances of direct copying.</p>
<p>Imagine a scenario where a train is moving at a speed of X meters per second and has a length of x meters.</p>
<p>Speed = length/time</p>
<p>While passing a pole, the formula for calculating the speed of a moving object is expressed as s= x/15.</p>
<p>Here's a rephrased version of the content to avoid plagiarism:

The speed of a train passing a platform is calculated using a formula. The formula is given as: s = (x + 100) / 25 (where x is the length of the train in meters).</p>
<p>We can derive the solution by setting both equations to be equal.</p>
<p>x/15= (x+100)/25</p>
<p>5x=300+3x</p>
<p>2x=300</p>
<p>x=150 meters</p>

<h2 class="h2 center">Second Round: Technical Interview Round</h2>
<hr>
<p>The technical interview is the second stage of Sapient's recruitment process where candidates are evaluated for their technical skills. This phase typically involves questions that test their proficiency in areas such as Java OOPs Concepts, Data Structure, C, and C++. The purpose of the round is to gauge the candidate's knowledge and abilities to determine their suitability for the role.</p>
<h2 class="h3">1) Differentiate between for loop and while loop in C?</h2>
<p>In the C programming language, programmers use 'for' and 'while' loops to execute a series of instructions repeatedly.</p>
<p><strong>The following describes the key distinctions between the two loops:</strong></p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>For loop</th>
<th>While loop</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The <strong>for loop</strong> can be declared as:<br>
for(initialization; condition; iteration)<br>
{<br>
//loop body; <br>
}</td>
<td>The <strong>while loop</strong> can be declared as:<br>
while(condition){<br>
statements;<br>
}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We use <strong>for loop</strong> when we know the number of iterations.</td>
<td>We use <strong>while loop</strong> when we do not know the number of iterations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In case the for loop does not have any conditions specified, it will run continuously in an infinite loop.</td>
<td>When the condition is not provided in the while loop, the code will not compile and throw an error.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When using a for loop, the statement written at the top of the loop will execute after all the other statements within the loop body have been executed.</td>
<td>It is possible to place the iteration statement at any position inside the while loop.</td>

<h2 class="h3">2) Define Null pointer and where can we use it?</h2>
<p>A null pointer refers to a type of pointer in computer memory that points to a location that is empty or contains no data. In simpler terms, a null pointer points to nothing or emptiness.</p>
<p><strong>The NULL pointer is utilized for various purposes in the C programming language.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The Null pointer is commonly applied to indicate the conclusion of a memory search.</li>
<li>When we don't want to provide a valid memory address as a function argument, we can pass a pointer that contains NULL value.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">3) What is static and dynamic binding?</h2>
<p>The concept of binding refers to the act of linking or connecting a specific method call with its respective method definition.</p>
<p><strong>Java has two types of binding that are used in programming.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Static Binding</li>
<li>Dynamic Binding</li>
</ul>
<p>Static binding occurs when the compiler is able to determine the object's type during the compilation process.</p>
<p>Dynamic binding refers to the capability of the compiler to determine the type of object at runtime. This enables the program to bind the correct method or function defined in the class hierarchy.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">4) Explain polymorphism in Java?</h2>
<p>Polymorphism is a fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows an action or behavior to be performed in multiple ways. In Java, this means that a method or object can have different forms and can be used in different contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Polymorphism can be classified into two distinct types:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Compile-time polymorphism</li>
<li>Runtime polymorphism</li>
</ul>
<p>Polymorphism can be implemented in Java through the use of two techniques: method overloading and method overriding. These techniques enable the creation of multiple methods with the same name but different parameters and behaviors, allowing for greater flexibility and reusability in programming.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">5) What are the various types of Polymorphism?</h2>
<p>There are two different types of polymorphism in the Java programming language.</p>
<ul class="pointsa">
<li>Static polymorphism</li>
<li>Dynamic polymorphism</li>
</ul>
<p>Static polymorphism can be referred to as compile-time polymorphism since it can be resolved during the compilation phase. Using method overloading, static polymorphism can be implemented in a class where multiple methods with the same name are present, but differ in terms of their parameters, return type, or the number of parameters.</p>
<p>Dynamic Polymorphism or runtime polymorphism is the ability for a program to resolve an overridden method call during runtime. Unlike compile-time polymorphism, where methods are resolved at the compile time, dynamic polymorphism allows calls to be made through the reference variable of the superclass. Therefore, this type of polymorphism is also known as late binding or dynamic method dispatch.</p>

<h2 class="h3">6) Differentiate between malloc () and calloc () function?</h2>
<p>Both malloc() and calloc() are C language functions for dynamically allocating memory, but they have distinct differences.</p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>malloc()</th>
<th>calloc()</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The function malloc() requires only a single parameter for the purpose of memory allocation.</td>
<td>The memory allocation function, calloc(), requires two arguments in order to be used effectively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The malloc() function is utilized to reserve a specific amount of memory as a single block.</td>
<td>The Calloc() function enables the allocation of several blocks of memory that are needed for a program's operation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The function called malloc() does not automatically set the contents of the allocated memory to any specific values.</td>
<td>The function calloc() provides allocated memory that is initialized to zero. It ensures that the memory is zeroed out before it is used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The speed of memory allocation is faster in malloc() function compared to calloc().</td>
<td>The speed of memory allocation is slower when compared to the use of the malloc() function.</td>

<h2 class="h3">12) Define inheritance in Java?</h2>
<p>Java Inheritance is a fundamental aspect of Object-oriented programming (OOP) which enables a class to obtain properties such as fields and behaviors from another class. Essentially, this means that the methods and fields of one class can be used by another class, thus increasing reusability and reducing the likelihood of duplication of effort in the coding process.</p>
<p>Inheritance is a concept of object-oriented programming that represents a hierarchical relationship between classes. It signifies the relationship of a parent class and its child classes, illustrating the "IS-A" dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>The essential aspects of inheritance in Java can be summarized as follows:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>A child class or derived class is a type of class that acquires the features and behaviors of another class, known as the parent class or superclass, through inheritance.</li>
<li>A parent class or superclass is a class that passes on its properties to another class through inheritance.</li>

<tr>
<td>Method overloading is a technique that enables us to achieve compile-time polymorphism. This means that at the time of compilation, the appropriate method is selected based on the number or types of arguments passed to it.</td>
<td>One way to achieve polymorphism at runtime is through method overriding. This involves defining a method in a subclass that has the same name and parameters as a method in its superclass, thereby replacing the superclass method with the subclass method during runtime. This allows for different behavior of the same method depending on the class instance it is invoked upon.</td>

<h2 class="h3">26) What is join in SQL? What are its types?</h2>
<p>In SQL, the Join statement is utilized to merge data or rows from multiple tables based on a given join condition. The joining condition requires at least (n-1) tables to be joined where n represents the number of tables. To carry out a join operation in SQL, the JOIN keyword is utilized.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the various types of join available in SQL.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In SQL, there exist four distinct types of Joins, which are used to combine data from two or more tables based on common columns.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Inner Join</li>
<li>Outer Join</li>
<li>Left Join</li>
<li>Right join.</li>

<h2 class="h3">27) What do you understand by the interface and abstract class?</h2>
<p>An Interface is a concept in programming that functions similarly to a class, but with a unique purpose. Rather than containing concrete methods and variables like a traditional class, all of the methods within an Interface are declared as abstract. The use of Interfaces in Java allows for the achievement of abstraction and multiple inheritance.</p>
<p>We can use the 'interface' keyword in Java to define an interface. An interface allows us to achieve full abstraction.</p>
<h3 class="h4">Syntax</h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
interface &lt;interface_name&gt;{ 
  
 // declare constant fields 
 // declare methods that abstract 
 // by default. 
} 
</textarea></div>
<p>Abstraction in Java can be achieved through the use of an abstract class. This class is created using the keyword 'abstract' and allows for complete or partial abstraction, meaning it can have both abstract and non-abstract methods. Unlike regular classes, an abstract class cannot be instantiated.</p>
<h3 class="h4">Syntax</h3>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
abstract class Class_Name {

<h2 class="h3">28) Differentiate between static and init block in Java?</h2>
<p>A static block is executed only once when a class object is created by the JVM, while an init block is executed every time a class object is created. If a class has both static and init blocks, the static block will be executed first followed by the init block on every object creation.</p>
<h3 class="h4">Example:</h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
class BlockBuild{
 
 static{
  System.out.println("This is Static block");
 }

 }
 public static void main (String[] args) {
 BlockBuild b= new BlockBuild();
 new BlockBuild();

 }
