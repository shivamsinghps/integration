<hr>
<h3 class="h3">10) What are the most commonly used programming languages nowadays? </h3>
<p>Various industries like education, healthcare, finance, and automotive rely on a range of programming languages to build their software applications. Here are some of the most popular programming languages commonly used in these industries:</p>
<p>C programming language is a widely-used general-purpose programming language that was created by Dennis M Ritchie in 1972 and developed at AT&T Bell Laboratory. This language is considered a mid-level programming language since it combines both a low-level and a high-level programming language. C is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and popularity, and it is widely used to build a variety of applications such as compilers, text editors, and network devices.</p>
<p>Java was developed in 1995 by Sun Microsystems as a high-level, reliable, and secure programming language. Its versatility and platform independence make it ideal for developing software in various industries, including banking, retail, IT, and Android. It is also commonly used for web and desktop applications, as well as in the research community. Currently, Oracle is the owner of Java.</p>
<p>Python Programming Language is a programming language that was created in the 1990s. It is popular due to its user-friendly nature, being open-source, and ease of learning. Python is used in various fields ranging from machine learning, artificial intelligence, big data, GUI-based desktop applications to robotics.</p>
<p>C++ is a programming language utilized in software development. It was developed in 1980 by Bjarne Stroustrup and is similar to the C programming language. However, it offers additional features such as type checking, object-oriented programming, and exception handling.</p>
<p>C# is a programming language that is commonly used with XML-based Web services on the .NET platform. It is an object-oriented language that is designed to improve productivity in web applications. Its name is pronounced as "C sharp" and it is considered a modern language. Those familiar with programming languages like C, C++, or Java can learn C# more easily.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a versatile scripting language that is commonly used on both client and server-side web development. It was created in the 1990s for the Netscape Navigator web browser, and it enables programmers to add powerful features to web pages and applications. By using JavaScript, developers can create interactive interfaces, dynamic websites, mobile applications, games, animated graphics, and more.</p>
<p>PHP is a programming language that is often used to create both static and dynamic websites. It was initially developed by Rasmus Laird in 1994, and it is open-source. One of the strengths of PHP is its ability to execute scripts on the server side. It can work in conjunction with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To save a PHP file, it is necessary to use the ".php" file extension.</p>
<p>R is a programming language that has gained significant popularity in the field of data analytics, statistical computing and scientific research. It is widely used for machine learning algorithms and data visualization, making it a valuable tool for marketers and data scientists. The language was created in 1993 by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman.</p>
<p>The Go programming language, also known as Golang, is a type of programming language that is open-source and used to develop software that is simple, efficient and reliable. It was created by a team consisting of Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson in 2007.</p>
<p>Ruby Programming Language is a powerful, open-source, and pure object-oriented programming language that was introduced in 1993. It can be used for both front-end and back-end web development purposes. The language was crafted primarily to compose CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">11) What is a constructor in an object-oriented programming language? </h3>
<p>In an object-oriented programming language that is class-based, a constructor is a method that is invoked automatically when an object of that class is created. This method, which shares the name of the class, initializes the data members of the newly created object. Although a constructor functions similarly to an instance method, it differs from it in important ways. Specifically, a constructor has no specified return type, it isn't inherited implicitly, and it is subject to different rules regarding access modifiers. </p>
<p>When you create an object in Java and don't define a constructor for it, the object will still look for a constructor to execute. In this case, Java generates a default constructor and uses it to create the object.</p>
<p>In the context of object-oriented programming, Java is a widely used programming language. To better explain this, let's consider an example. Constructors for Java programs follow two specific rules that should be adhered to.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The statement suggests that the name of a class and its constructor should be identical.</li>
<li>The content in question discusses the characteristics of a function. Specifically, it states that a function should not possess a return type.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a scenario where a Java class is named Vehicle.java. It only contains a constructor method. It is important to note that this method must have the same name as the class itself and there is no return type associated with it.</p>
<p><strong>Vehicle.java</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
// Vehicle.java 
public class Vehicle{ 
	public Vehicle(){ 
		System.out.println("This is an example of default constructor"); 
	} 
} 
Main.java
// Main.java 
public class Main{ 
	public static void main(String[] args){ 
		Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle(); 
		//when vehicle object is created, it directly calls Vehicle() 
		//constructor 
	} 
} 
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>This is an example of a default constructor
</pre></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">12) What is superclass in the Java programming language?</h3>
<p>A superclass in Java is a class that serves as a foundation for many subclasses. This means that subclasses can inherit all the properties of the superclass. For instance, if we take the example of a superclass called Vehicle, it could have subclasses like Bike, Car, Truck, Bus, and so on. The superclass is also known as a parent class or base class.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">13) What are the different OOPs principles in Java?</h3>
<p>The fundamental OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System) principles are present in all Object-oriented programming languages including Java. Java programming language also adheres to these principles which are as follows:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
<li>Abstraction</li>
<li>Encapsulation</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to understand the core principles of OOPs, it's important to first grasp the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming. OOP is a programming paradigm that involves designing a program using classes and objects. Objects are entities that have a state and a behavior, and can either be physical or logical. Examples include chairs, tables, laptops, bikes, pens, pencils, and keyboards. Objects are essentially instances of a class and take up space in memory, complete with a unique address.</p>
<p>An example of an object is a cow, which possesses various attributes such as breed, color, and name, as well as performing various actions like producing milk and feeding.</p>
<p>In programming, an object is an instance of a class. It can be thought of as a real-world entity which has properties and behaviors. Objects take up physical space in a program as they are created in memory. They are used to perform operations, store data, and interact with other objects. 

A class, on the other hand, is a logical entity. It is a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects of that class. It acts as a template for creating new objects with the same properties and methods. Classes do not take up any physical space in memory as they are not actual objects, but rather the definition of an object type.</p>
<p><strong>Inheritance</strong></p>
<p>In Java, Inheritance refers to the process by which a subclass acquires all the attributes and behaviors of a superclass. The superclass, also known as the parent class, passes on its properties and methods to the subclass, which is known as the child class. The primary purpose of inheritance is to enable runtime polymorphism and promote code reuse.</p>
<p><strong>Polymorphism</strong></p>
<p>Polymorphism is a crucial concept in object-oriented programming, allowing for tasks to be performed in multiple ways and data to be processed in various forms. Polymorphism is a combination of the words poly, meaning many, and morphism, meaning types. In Java, it is possible to achieve polymorphism through method overloading and method overriding.</p>
<p><strong>Abstraction</strong></p>
<p>Abstraction refers to the technique of concealing intricate details while presenting only its crucial functionalities. It omits extraneous information and presents a simplified version of the subject matter to the user. An excellent example is a phone call where the user is unaware of the underlying technical process involved in making the call.</p>
<p><strong>Encapsulation</strong></p>
<p>Encapsulation is a technique used to combine data into one unit. It functions as a tool that binds code and the data it is manipulating. Encapsulation acts as a safeguard that does not allow external code to access protected information. An example of encapsulation is seen in Java classes.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">14) What do you understand by IDE?</h3>
<p>An IDE, short for Integrated Development Environment, is a software application designed to provide computer programmers with a range of tools necessary to develop software. These can include a code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. An IDE streamlines the software development process by enabling programmers to build applications with all the necessary programs and libraries in one place.</p>
<p>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is an application software used for creating computer programs. It provides common developer tools in a graphical user interface (GUI). This software combines different programming tools to enhance software development productivity.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">15) What is multithreading in an Operating System? </h3>
<p>Multithreading refers to the capability of a program or an operating system process to handle multiple users and requests simultaneously, without requiring multiple copies of the code to be running on the system. Essentially, a CPU can execute multiple threads at once, allowing for greater efficiency and improved performance. It should be noted that multithreading is distinct from multiprocessing, which involves running multiple processes on a system at the same time.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">16) What is a framework in programming?</h3>
<p>A framework is a software solution for developers to create applications. It includes features such as input processing, hardware management, and systems software interaction. These frameworks provide the foundation for web developers to create software that's compatible with specific platforms. Typically, frameworks have a set of predefined functions and classes available.</p>
<p>A software framework is a pre-built platform that enables developers to create applications easily and efficiently. It is built and optimized by experienced software engineers, making it reliable and versatile. By using a software framework to develop applications, developers can concentrate on the application's key functions, while the framework handles the lower-level functionalities.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">17) What is the key difference between Abstract class and Interface?</h3>
<p>The following outlines the primary distinctions between Abstract classes and Interfaces:</p>
<table class="alt">

<h3 class="h3">28) What are the key differences between primary and secondary memory?</h3>
<p>Computer memory can be categorized into two main types - primary memory and secondary memory. Primary memory is the computer's internal memory that is directly accessed by the CPU for storing and retrieving data. In contrast, secondary memory refers to an external storage device that can be used for permanent data storage. While both types of memory serve the same purpose, they function differently. Here are some key differences between the two types of computer memory.</p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>Primary memory</th>
<th>Secondary memory</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Main memory, also known as primary memory, is a computer's primary storage area that can be directly accessed by the Central Processing Unit (CPU).</td>
<td>The reason why secondary memory must be transferred to the primary memory before being accessed by the processor is because the processor has no direct means of interacting with the secondary memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The memory that stores data temporarily until the execution of a process is known as primary memory.</td>
<td>Secondary memory refers to an external storage device that is utilized for permanent storage of data or information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Primary memory exhibits different properties depending on its type. Volatility characterizes the nature of RAM, while Non-volatility characterizes that of ROM.</td>
<td>Secondary storage is a type of computer memory that retains the stored data even when the power is turned off and is commonly referred to as non-volatile memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Semiconductor-based memory components are utilized as primary memory in various electronic devices.</td>
<td>Secondary memory devices rely on magnetic or optical technologies for storage. These types of memory allow for the long-term preservation of information in computing systems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Compared to secondary storage devices, primary memory devices have a higher price point.</td>
<td>The cost of secondary memory devices is relatively lower compared to primary memory devices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Primary memory can be referred to as Main memory or Internal memory.</td>
<td>Secondary memory can also be referred to as auxiliary memory or external memory.</td>
</tr>
