<h2 class="h2 center">IBM Recruitment Process</h2>
<hr>
<p>IBM's recruitment process for hiring fresher Software Developers involves multiple rounds of assessment and evaluation. Typically, 3-4 rounds are conducted to ensure that the most talented and qualified candidates are selected for the role.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Aptitude test</li>
<li>Technical interview</li>
<li>HR interview</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2">Academic Criteria:</h2>
<ul class="points">
<li>An acceptable GPA for B.Tech, as well as satisfactory results in Class X and XII, must be achieved by students with a minimum score of 65%.</li>
<li>The candidate should not have any pending or incomplete tasks or exams during the interview.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2">Written Round:</h2>
<p>The second round of the recruitment process is the Written round which is broken down into three main sections, including Number Series, General Aptitude Test, and English Assessment Test. The allotted time for Number Series and General Aptitude Test is 2.15 minutes, whereas for the English Assessment Test, the candidate would have 20 minutes. Both tests are multiple-choice and do not have timers per question like in the first round.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Technical Rounds:</h2>
<p>The second round of a tech job interview is typically an in-person interview for those who passed the written round. The questions asked in this round may vary depending on the interview panel, but it is essential to have a strong understanding of core concepts in computer science such as Data Structures and Algorithms, DBMS, Operating Systems, Networking and OOPs concepts, as well as proficiency in at least one programming language of your choice. Being well-prepared for the highlighted points on your resume will also be beneficial in this round.</p>
<h2 class="h2">HR Rounds:</h2>
<p>Sure, here's the rephrased content:

At times, individuals pose questions related to human resources, which are commonly referred to as HR questions.</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Can you share some information about yourself?</li>
<li>Why IBM?</li>
<li>Can you describe your personal strengths and weaknesses?</li>
<li>Question from Resume</li>
<li>Please provide the original content that needs to be rephrased.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="h2">Questions Asked in IBM:</h2>
<ol class="points">
<li>Insertion Sort</li>
<li>Selection Sort</li>
<li>Linked List</li>
<li>Sure, here's a rephrased version: 

There are various kinds of users in a database system with different roles and responsibilities. These include system administrators, database developers, application programmers, end-users, and database designers. Each user type has specific tasks and permissions within the database system.</li>
<li>Collection in Java</li>
<li>Java provides us with the ability to handle files through its file handling capabilities. With this feature, we can read, write, and modify files, among other things.</li>
<li>Sure, here's a rephrased version:

Can you explain the difference between overloading and overriding? 

Overloading and overriding are two important concepts in object-oriented programming. Overloading refers to defining multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters. Overriding, on the other hand, means defining a method in a subclass that has the same name and parameters as a method in its superclass. The difference between these two concepts lies in the way they are used and their purpose.</li>
<li>Can you compare and contrast Abstract Class and Interface?</li>

Original text: "The distance between the Earth and the Moon is approximately 238,855 miles."

Plagiarism-free text: The Moon is situated at a distance of roughly 238,855 miles from the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p> Let's assume A finishes the 600 m race in 60 sec, then 
600/60 = 10 m/sec is his speed 
B traveled (600-60 = 540 m in 60 sec, therefore 
540/60 = 9 m/sec is B's speed 
:</p>
<p> "in a race of 500 metres, B can beat C by 50 metres." 
500/9 = 55.56 sec is B's time to finish a 500 m race 
C traveled 500-50 = 450 m in 55.56 sec, therefore 
450/55.56 = 8.1 m/sec is C's speed 
:</p>
<p> By how many will A beat C in a race of 400 metres? 
400/10 = 40 sec for A to run a 400 m race 
C will travel 8.1*40 = 324 m in 40 sec therefore 
C will be 400-324 = 76 m behind when A crosses the finish line</p>

<div class="testanswer" id="answer4">
<p>A possible rephrasing of the content could be: The number of miles from San Francisco to Seattle is approximately 1000.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p> Give the yearly portion a chance to be Rs.100. The principal portion will be paid one year from now i.e. 3 years before it is in reality due. The second portion will be paid a long time from now i.e. 2 years before it is in reality due.  
The third portion will be paid 1 year before it is in reality due.  
The fourth portion will be paid on the day the sum is in reality due.  
On the main portion, the intrigue will be paid for a long time, on the second for a long time, on the third for 1 year, on the fourth for multi-year. Altogether an enthusiasm for a long time will be paid (3 + 2 + 1 + 0) on Rs. 100 @ 10%. Intrigue = (100 ï¿½ 6 ï¿½ 10)/100 = Rs. 60 and the essential is Rs 100 ï¿½ 4 = Rs 400. The aggregate credit that can be released is Rs. 400 + 60 = Rs. 460. Here the system of Chain Rule will be connected. I.e. for Rs. 460 the portion required is Rs. 100, for Rs. 4600 the portion required is 4600 ï¿½ 100/460 = Rs. 1000. </p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Here is a rephrased version of the content:

If a quick typist can finish a task in one hour and a moderate typist can finish the same task in three hours, how long will it take them to finish the task if they work together? The quick typist's hourly output is half of the moderate typist's output. When they work together, their combined output is equal to 5/6 of the total task per hour. Therefore, they will complete the task in 1 hour and 12 minutes or 6/5 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>To find the sum of numbers that are greater than 100 and divisible by 14, we need to first identify the nearest number to 100 that meets this criteria, which is 112. We then need to find the nearest number to 1000 that is less than 1000 and divisible by 14, which is 994. The series of numbers we need to sum is from 112 to 994. Adding up this series gives us a total of 35392, which is equal to 14 times the sum of the integers from 8 to 71.</p>

Original: "The capital city of France is Paris with a population of over 2 million people. It is known for its iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre Museum."

Rephrased: Paris, with a populace exceeding 2 million, serves as the capital of France. It is recognized for its notable attractions, including the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre Museum.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>In order to calculate the runs made by a batsman in their 51st inning, we need to add up their score after 50 innings, which would be 50 multiplied by their average score per inning. This gives us a total score after 50 innings. To find the total score after their 51st inning, we need to multiply the number of innings by the average score per inning for all of their innings played so far. This gives us the total score so far, including their 51st inning. Finally, to find their score in their 51st inning, we simply subtract their total score after 50 innings from their total score after 51 innings. If the batsman had not lost their wicket in their 51st inning, and if they had scored the same as their average score per inning, they would have made an unbeaten 50 runs in that inning.</p>

Plagiarism-free version: Two towns are located at a distance of 160 kilometers. The map indicates this distance with 4 cm on the map. I need to find the ratio of the real distance to the distance on the map.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>At noon, A travelled 40km and B travelled 40km in the opposite direction at 11am. They eventually headed towards each other to meet at their separation point. A had to travel for 2 hours at a speed of 20km/hr to cover a distance of 40km, while B had to travel for 3 hours at a speed of 40km/hr to cover a distance of 120km.</p>
<p>After traveling for 2 hours at 20 km/h and 6 hours at 40 km/h respectively, two people met at a certain point. The actual distance between them can be calculated by adding up the total distance traveled by both individuals, which comes out to be 160km.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>To avoid plagiarism, the content needs to be completely rewritten in one's own words, without copying any sentences or phrases from the original source. Here's a possible rephrased version of the statement:

A person who is visionary and imaginative can be seen as the opposite of a pragmatist, who tends to prioritize practicality over creativity. These two traits represent different approaches to problem-solving and decision-making. While a pragmatist focuses on what is feasible and effective in the present circumstances, a visionary looks beyond the status quo and envisions possibilities that may not yet exist. Both perspectives have their strengths and limitations, and often require a balance to achieve optimal outcomes.</p>

<h2 class="h2 center">IBM Technical Interview Questions</h2>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">1) What are the Semaphores?</h2>
<p>A semaphore is a method of synchronizing processes that are competing for access to a shared resource within a concurrent system, such as a multitasking operating system. It is an abstract data type or variable that is utilized to regulate access to this resource.</p>
<p><strong>The content states that two tasks have been assigned.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>wait (p) </li>
<li>signal (v) </li>
</ul>
<p>The concept of mutual exclusion signifies that when multiple processes are utilizing the same variable, other processes must wait until the process in the critical section completes its execution. Once the process in the critical section is completed, it notifies the other processes that they can enter the critical section.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">2) What is Synchronization? </h2>
<p>Synchronization is a crucial process in Data Protection Manager (DPM) that involves transferring updated information from a protected file server to a DPM server, and subsequently applying these changes to the duplicate of the protected data. This enables DPM to ensure that the replicas of the protected data are up-to-date and consistent with the source data on the file servers.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">3) What is the virtual memory?</h2>
<p>Virtual memory is a feature in an operating system that allows a computer to compensate for shortage of physical memory. It works by temporarily transferring data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage using both hardware and software.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">4) What are paging, faulting, and deadlock?</h2>
<p>In computer operating systems, paging is a technique used to manage memory. It involves the retrieval of data from secondary storage in standardized blocks called "pages" for use in main memory. This system enables the operating system to efficiently store and access data.</p>
<p><strong>Faulting: A page fault (now and then called #PF, PF or hard fault) is a sort of special case raised by PC equipment when a running system gets to a memory page that isn't right now mapped by the memory administration unit (MMU) into the virtual address space of a procedure.</strong></p>
<p>A deadlock occurs when two software programs need to access the same resource but end up blocking each other's access, causing both programs to stop functioning. Initially, computer operating systems could only run one program at a time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">5) Evaluate a+=a+ ++a if a=20 initially.</h2>
<p>Sure, here's an attempt:
    
When executing the statement "a += a+ (++a)", the value of "a" is first incremented by one due to "++a". After that, the statement evaluates to "a = a + a + (++a)". So, "a" is updated to 21, and then the statement calculates the sum of "a + a + a", resulting in 63.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">6) What is Process Scheduling?</h2>
<p>Procedure planning refers to the process undertaken by a procedure manager to remove an ongoing process from the CPU and select an alternative procedure using a particular methodology.</p>
<p>Multiprogramming operating systems rely on process planning as a key component. With these systems, several processes can be simultaneously loaded into executable memory, and the CPU is shared via time multiplexing among the loaded processes.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">7) Difference between Quick Sort and Merge Sort.</h2>
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Comparison</th>
<th>Quick Sort</th>
<th>Merge Sort</th>

<hr>
<h2 class="h3">8) What is Base Class and Derived Class? How are these two interrelated?</h2>
<p>In C++, inheritance is implemented using derivation. With derivation, a derived class is created by extending a base class. When defining a derived class, you specify the base class from which it derives.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">9) What is the advantage of inheritance in OOPS??</h2>
<p>Inheritance is commonly utilized to create new classes based on existing ones, allowing for the reuse of code and reducing development time. This inheritance process does not change the original classes themselves. By extending the properties of base classes, derived classes can generate more complex objects with enhanced functionality.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">10) What is Procedural Programming?</h2>
<p>Procedural programming is a methodology in programming which follows a linear or step-by-step process. This technique employs the use of subroutines or procedures to carry out specific tasks or calculations.</p>
<p>The term procedural programming is synonymous with imperative programming.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">11) What is the Entry Control Loop?</h2>
<p>A section control loop is designed to monitor the state of a system at the time of entry. If the condition or expression is true, the control is transferred to the body of the loop. This loop controls entry to the loop, hence the name section control loop.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">12) What is Variable Scope?</h2>
<p>A programming term, 'scope', refers to a specific area of a program where variables may be declared. Generally, there are three areas where variables can be declared: inside a function or block (known as local variables), within a function parameter definition (known as formal parameters), or outside of all functions (known as global variables).</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">13) What is Dangling Else problem?</h2>
<p>The issue of dangling else occurs when a nested if statement is used and the else clause is ambiguous as to which if statement it should be connected to. In the example given, the else clause needs to be connected to the outermost if statement, but it is instead attached to the innermost if statement, creating a dangling else problem.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">14) What is the Condition of Deadlock?</h2>
<p>A deadlock will only occur when four particular conditions are satisfied simultaneously.</p>
<ol class="points">
<li><strong>Mutual exclusion:</strong> at least one process must be held in a non-sharable mode.</li>
<li><strong>Hold and wait:</strong> there must be a process holding one resource and waiting for another. </li>
<li><strong>No preemption:</strong> resources cannot be preempted. </li>
<li><strong>Circular wait:</strong> there must exist a set of processes</li>
</ol>
<p>[p1, p2, Â­, pn] such that p1 is waiting for p2, p2 for p3, and so onÂ­.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">15) What does Object Oriented Database Management System (OODBMS)?</h2>
<p>An OODBMS is a type of database management system that enables the creation and organization of data as objects, allowing for classes of objects with inherited properties, methods, and subclasses. It is designed to support object-oriented programming principles, making it more intuitive and flexible than traditional database systems.</p>
<p>An ODMS, which stands for object database management system, is another term used for a type of database management system that is specifically designed to store and manage objects as data.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">16) Difference between Structure and Union.</h2>
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr>
<th>The Basis of Comparison</th>
<th>Structure</th>
<th>Union</th>

<h2 class="h3">17) What is the purpose of 'SUDO' Command?</h2>
<p>The purpose of using sudo is to execute a command with root privileges. On the other hand, su is used to switch the current user context. It is essentially a predecessor to sudo. When no specific username is specified for su, it switches to the root user account.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">18) What is the String?</h2>
<p>A string in programming refers to a series of values or symbols that are contiguous. It could be a character string, which is a sequence of characters, or a binary digits string, which is a string of binary values.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">19) What is an Array? What is the Importance of an Array?</h2>
<p>An array is a collection of data elements that are grouped together in a computer program. These elements often share the same data type, such as integers or strings. They are a fundamental data structure in programming, used to organize related values for efficient sorting and searching.</p>
<p><strong>Importance:</strong></p>
<p>Storing data of the same data type and size becomes more efficient and hassle-free when using arrays.</p>
<p>The data structure can hold multiple items in it, providing users with a means of storage for their data.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">20) What is the advantage and disadvantage of the stored procedure?</h2>
<p><strong>Advantage:</strong></p>
<ol class="points">
<li><strong>Maintainability: Since contents are in one area, updates and following of conditions in light of composition changes ends up less demanding.
</strong></li><li><strong><strong>Testing: Can be tried autonomous of the application.
</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Speed: 1. Stored Procedure is cache on the server.<br>
2. Execution plans for the process are easily reviewable without having to run the application.</strong></strong></strong></li><strong><strong>
</strong></strong></ol>
<p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Restricted Coding Functionality:</strong> Put away technique code isn't as hearty as application code, especially in the territory of circling (also that iterative builds, similar to cursors, are moderate and processor escalated)</li>
<li><strong>Testing:</strong> Any information blunders in dealing with Stored Procedures are not produced until runtime </li>
