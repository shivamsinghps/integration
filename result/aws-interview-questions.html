<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/aws-interview-questions.png" alt="AWS Interview Questions" class="imageright">
<p>Here are some commonly asked AWS interview questions along with their answers.</p>
<h3 class="h3">1) What is AWS?</h3>
<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing service that provides various IT resources on demand through its distributed IT infrastructure. AWS offers Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) models.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">2) What are the components of AWS?</h3>
<p>The key elements of Amazon Web Services (AWS) are as follows:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Simple Storage Service:</strong> S3 is a service of aws that stores the files. It is object-based storage, i.e., you can store the images, word files, pdf files, etc. The size of the file that can be stored in S3 is from 0 Bytes to 5 TB. It is an unlimited storage medium, i.e., you can store the data as much you want. S3 contains a bucket which stores the files. A bucket is like a folder that stores the files. It is a universal namespace, i.e., name must be unique globally. Each bucket must have a unique name to generate the unique DNS address.</li>
<li><strong>Elastic Compute Cloud:</strong> Elastic Compute Cloud is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. You can scale the compute capacity up and down as per the computing requirement changes. It changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for the resources that you actually use.</li>
<li><strong>Elastic Block Store:</strong> It provides a persistent block storage volume for use with EC2 instances in aws cloud. EBS volume is automatically replicated within its availability zone to prevent the component failure. It offers high durability, availability, and low-latency performance required to run your workloads.</li>
<li><strong>CloudWatch:</strong> It is a service which is used to monitor all the AWS resources and applications that you run in real time. It collects and tracks the metrics that measure your resources and applications. If you want to know about the CloudWatch in detail, then click on the below link: <a href="aws-cloudwatch-ec2.html">Click here</a></li>

<h3 class="h3">5) What are the pricing models for EC2 instances?</h3>
<p>There are several ways of pricing EC2 instances.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>On-Demand instance</strong>
<ul class="points">
<li>On-demand pricing, also referred to as pay-as-you-go, is a flexible pricing model that enables users to only pay for the resources they consume. This approach allows for more cost-effective usage of services as you are only charged for what you actually use.</li>
<li>The cost of using AWS compute capacity varies based on the specific instances you run, with pricing typically calculated per hour or per second.</li>
<li>No upfront payment is necessary for an On-Demand instance.</li>
<li>With On-Demand instances, it's possible to adjust the computing capacity of your application as needed. You have the flexibility to increase or decrease capacity depending on your application's requirements.</li>
<li>It is suggested that On-Demand instances are suitable for applications with unforeseeable and short-term workloads.</li>
<li>Individuals or organizations seeking affordable and flexible options for using EC2 instances without any initial payments would benefit from this service.</li>
<li>On-Demand instances are ideal for applications that are being deployed or tested on EC2 for the first time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reserved instance</strong>
<ul class="points">
<li>A Reserved Instance is a pricing model that can help lower the cost of your AWS usage. By committing to a specific service, you can make an upfront payment and receive a discount, which can be useful for services that you know you'll need in the future.</li>
<li>Reserved instances offer significant cost savings of up to 75% when compared to On-Demand instances.</li>
<li>Reserved instances are utilized for specific computing capacity and are designated to an Availability Zone, ensuring that the capacity is reserved and available whenever needed.</li>
<li>It is advisable to use reserved instances for applications that have a fixed workload and need constant capacity. The reserve capacity provided by reserved instances is particularly beneficial in such cases.</li>
<li>One way for customers to lower their computing costs when using EC2 for a period of 1 to 3 terms is by using reserved instances.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Spot instance</strong>
<ul class="points">
<li>Spot instances offer users access to spare computing capacity at a significantly reduced cost compared to on-demand pricing.</li>
<li>The Reserved Instance provides a significant cost advantage of up to 90% in comparison to the On-Demand instance.</li>
<li>The most suitable use case for spot instances is with applications that have variable start and end times.</li>
<li>Low-cost computing capacity is a beneficial solution for applications that require ample computational resources at an affordable price.</li>
<li>In case there is an urgent need for extra computational power, cloud computing services can be highly beneficial for applications. They offer scalability to cater to the increased capacity requirements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dedicated Hosts</strong><br>
It is a physical EC2 server which is dedicated for your use. It reduces the overall costs by providing you a VPC that comprise of a dedicated hardware.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3">7) How many buckets can be created in S3?</h3>
<p>The system allows users to create a maximum of 100 buckets by default.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">8) What is Cross Region Replication?</h3>
<p>Cross Region Replication is a feature offered by AWS that allows for the duplication of data from one storage bucket to another, even if they are located in different regions. This service copies data asynchronously, meaning that files are not immediately duplicated when they are created or updated. For further information on the topic, follow the link provided below.</p>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">14) What is Auto Scaling?</h3>
<p>Auto Scaling is a useful feature offered by AWS that automatically adjusts capacity in order to maintain consistent and reliable performance. By utilizing Auto Scaling, it is possible to quickly scale multiple resources across various AWS services. Additionally, Amazon EC2 Auto-Scaling can be combined with the Auto Scaling feature to scale additional resources for other AWS services.</p>
<p><strong>Auto Scaling offers several advantages that make it a valuable tool for managing resources on a public cloud. Its ability to automatically adjust the resources allocated to an application according to its demand reduces the risk of underutilization or resource depletion. This ensures that the service is always available to users, even during peak periods. Auto Scaling also offers cost-saving benefits by allowing businesses to pay only for the resources actually used. Furthermore, it saves time and effort that would otherwise be required to manually manage resource allocation.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Setup Scaling Quickly</strong><br>
It sets the target utilization levels of multiple resources in a single interface. You can see the average utilization level of multiple resources in the same console, i.e., you do not have to move to the different console.</li>
<li><strong>Offer wise choices when it comes to scaling up operations.</strong><br>
It makes the scaling plans that automate how different resources respond to the changes. It optimizes the availability and cost. It automatically creates the scaling policies and sets the targets based on your preference. It also monitors your application and automatically adds or removes the capacity based on the requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Automatically maintain performance</strong><br>
Auto Scaling automatically optimize the application performance and availability even when the workloads are unpredictable. It continuously monitors your application to maintain the desired performance level. When demand rises, then Auto Scaling automatically scales the resources.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">15) What is AMI?</h3>
<p>An AMI is the abbreviation for Amazon Machine Image. It is utilized for creating virtual machines within EC2 instances. To learn more about AMI, follow the link provided below.</p>
<a href="aws-ami.html">Click Here</a>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">16) Can a AMI be shared?</h3>
<p>Certainly. It is possible to share an AMI with others.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">17) What is an EIP?</h3>
<p>EIP or Elastic IP address is a feature offered by EC2 instances in AWS. It provides a fixed IP address that is linked to an EC2 instance. This IP address is associated with your AWS account, rather than a specific EC2 instance. You have the option of detaching your EIP address from one instance and attaching it to another instance within your AWS account.</p>
<p><strong>Sure! So, let's discuss EIP and how it works using an example.</strong></p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/aws-interview-questions2.png" alt="AWS Interview Questions">
<p>In the case where a website, such as www.javatpoint.com, is linked to an EC2 instance through its public IP address, restarting the instance will result in the assignment of a new public IP address. This causes the original link between the website and the instance to become invalid. To prevent this issue, AWS provides Elastic IP addresses, which are static and do not change. Using an Elastic IP address ensures that the connection between the website and the EC2 instance remains stable even when the instance is restarted.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">18) What are the different storage classes in S3?</h3>
<p>Storage classes are designed to help prevent data loss in one or more locations. Every object in Amazon S3 is associated with a storage class, which can be selected based on specific needs and offers high durability. There are different types of storage classes available in Amazon S3, all of which provide high levels of data protection. For further information on the various types of storage classes, please click on the provided link.</p>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">19) How can you secure the access to your S3 bucket?</h3>
<p>There are two approaches to securing an S3 bucket.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>ACL or Access Control List is a security feature that determines which users or systems have access to specific resources or services.</strong><br>
ACL is used to manage the access of resources to buckets and objects. An object of each bucket is associated with ACL. It defines which AWS accounts have granted access and the type of access. When a user sends the request for a resource, then its corresponding ACL will be checked to verify whether the user has granted access to the resource or not.<br>
When you create a bucket, then Amazon S3 creates a default ACL which provides a full control over the AWS resources.</li>
<li><strong>Bucket Policies</strong><br>
Bucket policies are only applied to S3 bucket. Bucket policies define what actions are allowed or denied. Bucket policies are attached to the bucket not to an S3 object but the permissions define in the bucket policy are applied to all the objects in S3 bucket.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Below are the primary components that comprise a Bucket policy:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Sid</strong><br>
A Sid determines what the policy will do. For example, if an action that needs to be performed is adding a new user to an Access Control List (ACL), then the Sid would be <strong>AddCannedAcl</strong>. If the policy is defined to evaluate IP addresses, then the Sid would be <strong>IPAllow</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Effect:</strong> An effect defines an action after applying the policy. The action could be either to allow an action or to deny an action.</li>
<li><strong>Principal</strong><br>
A Principal is a string that determines to whom the policy is applied. If we set the principal string as '*', then the policy is applied to everyone, but it is also possible that you can specify individual AWS account.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong><br>
An Action is what happens when the policy is applied. For example, s3:Getobject is an action that allows to read object data.</li>
<li><strong>Resource</strong><br>
The Resource is a S3 bucket to which the statement is applied. You cannot enter a simply bucket name, you need to specify the bucket name in a specific format. For example, the bucket name is javatpoint-bucket, then the resource would be written as "arn:aws:s3""javatpoint-bucket/*".</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">20) What are policies and what are the different types of policies?</h3>
<p>A policy is linked to a resource and serves as a way to determine permissions for making requests. When a user makes a request, AWS evaluates the policies to determine whether to allow or deny an action based on the permissions outlined in the policy. Policies are stored as JSON documents.</p>
<p><strong>AWS offers six different policy types that users can utilize.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Identity-based policies</li>
<li>Resource-based policies</li>
<li>Permissions boundaries</li>
<li>Organizations SCPs</li>
<li>Access Control Lists</li>
<li>Session policies</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/aws-interview-questions3.png" alt="AWS Interview Questions">
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Identity-based policies</strong><br>
Identity-based policies are the permissions stored in the form of JSON format. This policy can be attached to an identity user, group of users or role. It determines the actions that the users can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions.<br>
<strong>Identity-based policies are divided into two groups:</strong>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Managed Policies:</strong> Managed Policies are the identity-based policies which can be attached to multiple users, groups or roles. There are two types of managed policies:
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>AWS Managed Policies</strong><br>
AWS Managed Policies are the policies created and managed by AWS. If you are using the policies first time, then we recommend you to use AWS Managed Policies.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Managed Policies</strong><br>
Custom Managed Policies are the identity-based policies created by user. It provides more precise control over the policies than AWS Managed Policies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Inline Policies</strong><br>
Inline Policies are the policies created and managed by user. These policies are encapsulated directly into a single user, group or a role.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Resource-Based Policies</strong><br>
Resource-based policies are the policies which are attached to the resource such as S3 bucket. Resource-based policies define the actions that can be performed on the resource and under what condition, these policies can be applied.</li>
<li><strong>Permissions boundaries</strong><br>
Permissions boundaries are the maximum permissions that identity-based policy can grant to the entity.</li>
<li><strong>Service Control Policies (SCPs) refer to a set of rules used to manage permissions in AWS environments. These policies help to govern the actions that can be performed by users and resources within an AWS account.</strong><br>
Service Control Policies are the policies defined in a JSON format that specify the maximum permissions for an organization. If you enable all the features in an Organization, then you can apply Service Control Policies to any or all of your AWS accounts. SCP can limit the permission on entities in member accounts as well as AWS root user account.</li>
<li><strong>The following content discusses Access Control Lists (ACLs). An Access Control List (ACL) is a security mechanism used to control access to resources based on a set of rules or permissions. It is a list of permissions linked to an object, such as a file or a directory, that specifies which users or groups can access the object and the actions they are allowed to perform on it. ACLs are essential for maintaining the security of computer systems, as they allow administrators to control who can access sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.</strong><br>
ACL defines the control that which principals in another AWS account can access the resource. ACLs cannot be used to control the access of a principal in a different AWS account. It is the only policy type which does not have the JSON policy document format.</li>

<h3 class="h3">44) What are the types of AMI provided by AWS?</h3>
<p>AWS offers two categories of Amazon Machine Image (AMI).</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Instance store backed</strong>
<ul class="points">
<li>An EC2 instance that is backed by an instance store has its root device stored on the hard drive of the virtual machine.</li>
<li>When an instance is formed, the AMI is duplicated to produce the instance.</li>
<li>Since "<strong>instance store-backed</strong>" instances root device is stored in the virtual machine's hard drive, so you cannot stop the instance. You can only terminate the instance, and if you do so, the instance will be deleted and cannot be recovered.</li>
<li>In the event of a hard drive failure in the virtual machine, any data stored within it may be lost.</li>
<li>You need to leave this <strong>instance-store</strong> instance in a running state until you are completely done with it.</li>
<li>Your billing period for using an instance on a cloud computing platform begins at the moment of instance startup and ends when the instance is terminated. During this time, you'll be charged at the applicable rate for your instance usage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>EBS backed</strong>
<ul class="points">
<li>An EC2 instance that utilizes an EBS volume as its primary (root) device is known as an "EBS backed" instance.</li>
<li>EBS volumes are not bound to a specific virtual hardware, but they are limited to a certain availability zone. This indicates that within the same availability zone, an EBS volume can be transferred from one machine to another.</li>
<li>In the event of a virtual machine malfunction, it is possible to transfer the virtual machine to another host, allowing it to continue functioning seamlessly.</li>
<li>Choosing an "EBS-backed" instance offers the key benefit of being able to stop the instance and store its EBS volume for future use. This allows for the virtual machine to be utilized for another instance, and while it is stopped, you won't be charged for the EBS storage. In comparison, an "instance store-backed" instance cannot be stopped and the data on its drives will be lost if it is terminated or fails.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">45) What is Amazon EMR?</h3>
