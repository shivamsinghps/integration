<h1 class="h1">Top Most asked Amazon Interview Questions</h1>
<p>According to Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, he would rather go through the process of interviewing 50 individuals for a position and not select anyone than make the mistake of hiring the wrong person.</p>
<p>Amazon's recruitment process is known for its robustness, as evidenced by the CEO's statement. It's not about intentionally wanting someone to fail, but rather about only hiring individuals who have proven themselves capable and deserving.</p>
<p>In this piece, we'll discuss the Amazon interview process, the technical areas to focus on for the interview, and tips for effectively responding to the interviewer's questions.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Amazon's Interview Process</h2>
<p>The selection process will consist of 5 stages, with one online coding test and four interview rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Paraphrase the given content to avoid plagiarism.</strong></p>
<p>The exam entails answering two programming tasks within a given time limit of two hours. In addition to the code implementation, the examinee is required to provide a written description of their approach and the algorithm's time and space complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Please provide me with the content that needs to be rephrased so that I can assist you in avoiding plagiarism.</strong></p>
<p>During this round, you will encounter 2 to 4 coding questions that will assess your skills in problem solving and data structures. The type of questions given will depend on your level of experience; typically, those who are less experienced will be given more coding rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Sure, here's the rewritten content:

This round is known as the design interview round. In this round, the interviewer will present a design problem or challenge for the candidate to solve. The goal of this round is to assess the candidate's problem-solving skills and how well they can apply their design knowledge and experience to solve a real-world problem. The candidate will typically be expected to present their design solution to the interviewer and explain their thought process behind it.</strong></p>
<p>For this stage of the interview process, candidates may be expected to demonstrate their understanding of high-level design architecture for real-life products and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles when designing components. However, it's worth noting that this round may be waived for entry-level positions in software engineering.</p>
<p><strong>"Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work or ideas without giving them proper credit. It is considered unethical and can lead to serious consequences, including legal action. In order to avoid plagiarism, it is important to properly cite your sources and always give credit where credit is due." 

Rephrased: To avoid plagiarism, it is essential to acknowledge and give credit to the original author or source. Failure to do so may result in legal action and be deemed as unethical. Therefore, it is recommended to cite all sources used appropriately.</strong></p>
<p>During the hiring process, the cultural fit of a candidate is evaluated through a round of interviews with the hiring manager. This involves assessing their attitude and experience in relation to the company's culture. General HR questions are asked, as well as inquiries about the candidate's previous work experience. In this round, the interviewer may discuss the candidate's past projects and ask behavioral questions based on those experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Reword the following text to ensure that it does not contain any copied elements.</strong></p>
<p>The final interview round is known as the optional bar raiser round, which comprises all the elements from the prior rounds. This round involves a senior engineering manager who will ask about your previous projects and ask behavioral questions as well. The purpose of this round is to evaluate whether you possess a higher level of technical expertise compared to the average individual within the Amazon team.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Technical topics you must prepare for Amazon's Interview.</h2>
<p><strong>Programming Language</strong></p>
<p>When interviewing for a technology position at Amazon, there is no requirement for expertise in a particular programming language. However, it's important to have familiarity with the syntax of languages like Java, C/C++, C#, Python, or Ruby. It's also essential to understand topics such as memory management and common libraries and collections.</p>
<p><strong>Data Structures</strong></p>
<p>It is crucial for you to have a solid grasp of data structures to excel in technical interviews for Amazon. As data management is a core part of their business, you'll need to have in-depth knowledge and understanding of various data structures and how they function in different applications. It's important to compare and contrast these structures to determine the most efficient methods for storing and accessing data.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithms</strong></p>
<p>To be proficient in algorithm development, it's essential to have a comprehensive understanding and knowledge of fundamental algorithms such as divide and conquer, traversals, breadth-first search vs. depth-first search, among others. It's crucial to comprehend the benefits and limitations of each type of algorithm. Therefore, it's advisable to emphasize learning and implementing the various categories of algorithms rather than rote memorization.</p>
<p><strong>Coding</strong></p>
<p>In order to prepare for a coding interview, it's important to practice writing syntactically correct code, as opposed to just using pseudocode. It's recommended to practice writing code without relying on an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and using pen and paper can be helpful. When evaluating your code, companies typically prioritize scalability, robustness, and thorough testing. Focusing on these factors can increase your chances of success in the interview process.</p>
<p><strong>Object-oriented Design</strong></p>
<p>Creating effective software requires careful design to ensure it is both extensible and maintainable. Object-oriented design is a recommended approach to writing good software as it allows for greater flexibility. Having knowledge of common design patterns and being able to write software in an object-oriented way are important skills for success.</p>
<p><strong>Databases</strong></p>
<p>When applying for a job at Amazon, it's important to have a good understanding of non-relational databases. Amazon has created tools such as DynamoDB to make it easier for their developer community to use the benefits of non-relational databases. Having knowledge of both relational and non-relational databases is beneficial when applying for a position with the company.</p>
<p><strong>Operating Systems</strong></p>
<p>The potential employee should have knowledge of certain Operating System concepts to improve the efficiency of their programming, including memory allocation, process management, thread synchronization, page replacement, and multi-threading.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Topics</strong></p>
<p>Having an understanding of the basics of the internet is essential. This includes knowledge of how browsers operate, such as DNS lookups and TCP/IP, as well as socket connections.</p>
<p><strong>Fundamental concepts behind machine learning and artificial intelligence.</strong></p>
<p>Prior knowledge of machine learning and artificial intelligence is necessary, specifically in areas such as data-driven modeling, train/test protocols, statistical significance, and error analysis. It is recommended to review relevant materials from resources such as textbooks to enhance one's understanding of these concepts.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Some examples of technical Interview Questions</h2>
<h3 class="h3">There are two integer arrays A and B, of size N given. There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is A[i]. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank, and it costs B[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.</h3>
<p><strong>Find the index of the gas station from where you can start your journey such that you can complete one full loop of the circuit. In case it's not possible to complete the loop, return -1.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can only travel in one direction. i to i+1, i+2, â€¦ n-1, 0, 1, 2.. Completing the circuit means starting at i and ending up at i again.</strong></p>
<p>The scenario involves two integer arrays - cost and gas - and the objective is to travel to "n" destinations, where "n" is the number of elements in the arrays. A car is presumably available for the journey.</p>
<p>The approach to solving the problem would be to select a starting point, such as 3, for example. Then, to move to the next point, we must ensure that we have enough fuel to cover the distance and that the cost of gas at that point is less than the fuel we have available.</p>
<p><strong>See the example:</strong></p>
<p>Here's an original rephrased sentence: 

Let's consider an array of gas values comprising the set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.</p>
<p>Sorry about that! Here's a rephrased version: 

Here are five different items, and their respective costs: 3, 4, 5, 1, and 2.</p>
<p>This passage cannot be plagiarized as it is an original answer. However, I can rephrase it as follows: The third term in the sequence belonging to the gas category has a value of 4, counting from the first term as the 0th index.</p>
<p>To reach the 5th position in the gas station line, the amount of gas in our vehicle must be greater than the required cost. This is because when gas prices are less than the cost, we cannot progress in the queue. In this scenario, the cost is 1 and the vehicle has 4 units of gas, making it sufficient to proceed towards the 5th position.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the amount of gas required to travel to the next point is displayed. Upon arrival at the destination, there will still be 3 units of gas remaining, as you started with 4 and used 1 to reach the next point.</p>
<p>Once you reach the next checkpoint, you'll start off with three units of fuel.</p>
<p>The problem at hand is to determine the starting point from where all the given points can be visited in a sequence.</p>
<p>Let's consider the given set of arrays for gas and cost:</p>
<p>gas = {1,2}</p>
<p>cost= {2,1}</p>
<p>Let's begin with the initial element which is located at index 0.</p>
<p>Let me paraphrase the given content to ensure it is not plagiarized. After the first travel, the amount of gas left in the car can be calculated by subtracting the amount of gas used (cost) from the initial amount of gas (gas[0]). For instance, if the initial gas amount is 1 and the cost of the first travel is 2, the gas remaining in the car will be -1.</p>
<p>The negative value obtained means that it is not possible to use zero index for traversal.</p>
<p>Let's begin from the second indexed element.</p>
<p>We can calculate the remaining gas in our car after the first trip by subtracting the amount of gas used (represented by "cost") from the initial amount of gas (represented by "gas"). For example, if we started with 2 gallons of gas and used 1 gallon during the first trip, we would have 1 gallon of gas left.</p>
<p>After using up almost all of our gas, we finally have just one unit left. If we continue to drive, we will soon reach the 0th index in our journey. By calculating the remaining gas and subtracting the cost, we found that we will have exactly 0 units of gas left when we get there.</p>
<p>Consequently, it follows that our journey can be accomplished beginning from the first index.</p>
<p><strong>This content has not been plagiarized and therefore does not need to be paraphrased. However, here is a possible rephrasing: There exist two different methods for resolving this issue.</strong></p>
<p>The first solution would be to use two loops and check whether the index exists but will take higher time and O(nÂ²) time complexity.</p>
<p><strong>An alternative method for resolving this issue is to perform the following set of instructions:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Take a variable <strong>start</strong> and initialize it to 0, and another variable <strong>end</strong> and then initialize it to 1.</li>
<li>A loop will be used to iterate through the array from start to end. During the iteration, the value of end will be incremented until it reaches the same value as the starting index. For instance, if the array has a length of 5, the iteration will go through 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;0. By doing this, we will be able to establish that the starting index is where the answer lies.</li>
<li>To keep track of the available gas in our vehicle, we will create a new variable called curr. If curr falls below zero, this indicates that the current index is not a suitable starting point. In this scenario, we will increase the value of our start variable by 1 to continue searching for a valid starting index.</li>
<li>Here, the main problem is that we know how to move forward in an array. I mean, we know how to increment the current pointer. But how do we get back? Here, the pointer goes like this: 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6â€¦â€¦. and so on. It won't come back like: 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;1.</li>
<li>To overcome this issue, we can apply a simple technique. Instead of directly increasing the value of 'n' as n=n+1, we can use the modulo operator and set it to the length of the list. This will help us reuse the index values once we reach the end of the list.</li>
<li>If the pointer reaches the end, it will reset to zero and begin again from the start.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sorry, but I cannot provide an answer as there is no content or problem given in the prompt. Please provide the content and prompt so I can rephrase it without plagiarism.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Find the K largest elements from a big file or array. / Write an efficient program for printing k largest elements in an array. Elements in the array can be in any order.</h3>
<p>Consider an array with the elements 10, 13, 2, 69, 40, 29, and 70. If we need to extract the top 3 elements from the array, the program should output 70, 69, and 40.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Method 1 (Using Sorting Method)</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>One way to solve the problem is by performing a sorting algorithm on the elements of the array. Specifically, we can sort the elements in a descending order which would take a time complexity of O(nLogn).</li>
<li>Display the initial k elements of the array after it has been sorted, with a time complexity of O(k).</li>

<p>The time complexity of a certain algorithm is O(nlogn).</p>
<h3 class="h3">Method 2 (Using Bubble sort k times)</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>Alter the Bubble Sort algorithm by restricting the number of times the outer loop runs to a maximum of k.</li>
<li>Output the final k elements of the array generated in the previous step.</li>
</ul>
<p>The time complexity of an algorithm is O(nk).</p>
<h4 class="n">Note: Like Bubble sort, we can use other sorting algorithms like Selection Sort to get the k largest elements.</h4>
<h3 class="h3">Method 3 (Using temporary array) K largest elements from arr[0..n-1]</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>To implement the algorithm for selecting the top k elements from a set, it is necessary to create a temporary array called temp, which will be used to store the first k elements of the set.</li>
<li>Determine the minimum value in the array temp[] by identifying the element with the smallest value and calling it min.</li>
<li>The time complexity of a loop that iterates through each element x in the array from the k-th index to the n-1 index is O(n-k).</li>
<li>If the value of x is higher than the smallest number in the temp array, then the minimum number in the temp array should be removed and replaced with x.</li>
<li>To implement selection sort, first find the smallest element in the array and swap it with the first element. Then, find the second smallest element and swap it with the second element, and so on until the array is sorted. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2) as it requires nested loops to iterate through the array. Additionally, to find the smallest element, a linear scan of the remaining unsorted elements is needed.</li>
<li>Output the last k elements of the array named 'temp[]'.</li>
</ul>
<p>The time complexity for using the sliding window technique for finding all subarrays of size k in an array of size n is O((n-k)*k). If the output is required to be sorted, the time complexity will be O((n-k)*k + klogk).</p>
<h3 class="h3">Method 4 (Using Max Heap)</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>Create a Max Heap tree efficiently in O(n) time complexity.</li>
<li>To obtain the top k largest elements from a Max Heap, we can use the Extract Max operation k times. This operation has a time complexity of O(klogn).</li>
</ul>
<p>The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n + klogn).</p>
<h3 class="h3">Method 5 (Using Min Heap)</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>Create a Min Heap MH using the first k elements (arr[0] to arr[k-1]) of the given array. This operation has a time complexity of O(k).</li>
<li>One can compare each element in an array (from arr[k] to arr[n-1]) with the root of a Min Heap data structure after the kth element. This helps to ensure that the Min Heap property is maintained.</li>
<li>Firstly, the element to be added is compared with the root element. If it's smaller than the root, it is added as a new leaf to the left-most position in the last level of the tree. However, if it's larger than the root, it is made the new root and the previous root is added as a new element in the last level, in the left-most available position. Secondly, if the element being added is greater than the root, then it replaces the root and the heapify operation is performed for the modified heap. If it's smaller than the root, then it's simply added as a new leaf. The complexity of step two is O((n-k)*logk).</li>
<li>A Max Heap is a data structure that arranges elements such that the root node contains the largest element. It satisfies the Max Heap property where every node's value is greater than or equal to its children. To find k largest elements, we can create a Max Heap of size k and iteratively add elements from the input list. If an element is greater than the root, we remove the root and add the new element to the heap. This way, the Max Heap stores k largest elements, and the root node contains the kth largest element.</li>
</ul>
<p>The time complexity for an algorithm is O(k + (n-k)Logk) if an unsorted output is required. However, if a sorted output is necessary, the time complexity becomes O(k + (n-k)Logk + kLogk).</p>

<h2 class="h2padding">Most asked HR questions at Amazon</h2>
<h3 class="h3">1) Why do you want to work at Amazon? / Why have you chosen Amazon?</h3>
<p>One common question asked during HR interviews is about the candidate's opinion on the company they are applying for. While there is no correct answer to this question, it is important to provide a specific explanation rather than making a general statement like "this is a great company." The candidate should be prepared with a thoughtful response to support their perspective.</p>
<p>Sure, I can help with that. Can you please provide me with the original content so that I can rephrase it for you?</p>
<p><strong>An Engineer answer:</strong></p>
<p>I am interested in pursuing a career at Amazon, as I believe I can contribute to the company's expansion into the field of home automation. My specific area of interest lies in (specify the niche you want to apply in), which aligns with Alexa division's focus on the same. Given my background and experience, drawing from my work on Big Data, smart meters, and home automation during my Master's research project, I believe I can add significant value to the team.</p>
<p><strong>Sure, here's a rephrased version:

"As a finance manager, I am responsible for overseeing and managing various financial aspects of a company. This includes creating and analyzing financial reports, making budget projections, overseeing financial transactions, and managing cash flow. My role is crucial in ensuring the financial stability and success of the company, and I work closely with other departments to ensure that financial decisions are aligned with the overall goals and objectives of the organization."</strong></p>
<p>I am interested in pursuing a career at Amazon due to its status as a leading international online retailer, with a Net Sales figure of over 136 billion USD and ranking 12th on the Fortune 500 list. With significant growth in sales over the past four years, Amazon is at the forefront of innovation in online retail. I believe that working at Amazon would offer me opportunities to utilize my skills and knowledge to contribute to the company's success. Additionally, I am attracted to the challenges presented by this role, which I have also encountered in my previous work experience.</p>
<p><strong>As an AI language model, I am not capable of determining whether the original content provided was plagiarized or not. However, I can provide a sample paraphrased content for you:

As a sales manager or product manager, when asked about the significance of market research in their field, they may answer along these lines: Conducting market research is crucial in understanding the needs, preferences, and behaviors of our target audience and evaluating the competition. With this information, we can make informed decisions and develop effective strategies to meet our customers' demands and gain a competitive advantage in the market. Market research also helps us identify new opportunities for growth and innovation, making it an essential tool for any business.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon attracts me as a company to work for because of various reasons:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>One of my primary motivations for working at Amazon is the potential to develop and market products that can greatly influence society. My professional background in senior positions of sales and marketing within the consumer goods industry has led me to appreciate Amazon's exceptional product quality and delivery efficiency, giving it a competitive edge against similar companies. I am excited about the prospect of contributing my skills and experience to help Amazon continue to succeed and take a leading role in the industry.</li>
<li>I take pleasure in delving into intricate details and maintaining a strong connection to my work. Considering Amazon's reputation as a data-focused corporation, I feel that I could employ data analysis skills in a potential position with them.</li>
<li>During my time working in the FMCG industry, I was able to foster an interest in understanding consumer behavior and developing effective marketing strategies to meet their needs. This involved empathizing with consumers and working towards building their trust and loyalty. I feel that joining Amazon would provide me with a platform to apply my skills on a larger scale.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">2) Do you know our CEO? How do you pronounce his name?</h3>
<p>This question is often asked in interviews to ensure that candidates have done adequate research on the company they are applying for. Although many people are familiar with tech giants like Amazon and their leaders, this question is asked to see how well the candidate pronounces the company's name. Jeff Bezos has been the CEO of Amazon since 1996 and his name is pronounced as "Bay-zohs" rather than "Bee-zos."</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">3) How would you solve problems if you were from Mars?</h3>
<p>Sure! Here's a rephrased version:

The purpose of this question is to evaluate your level of creativity. The interviewer wants to know if you possess the ability to think creatively and come up with unique solutions. You can respond by offering a creative solution to a customer's problem, suggesting a novel approach to an internal process, or proposing an innovative strategy to increase sales. The key is to showcase your ability to think outside of conventional methods.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">4) Tell the story of the last time you had to apologize to someone.</h3>
<p>This question is designed to assess your willingness to accept responsibility for your mistakes and your ability to work in a team. It's an important aspect that recruiters look for in a candidate. You may have made mistakes in the past, but choose an example where you took responsibility for your actions, apologized and made things right. Avoid saying that you haven't had to apologize before as this implies an unwillingness to admit mistakes.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">5) What is the most difficult situation you have ever faced in your life? How did you handle it?</h3>
<p>The interviewer is interested in knowing your perspective on the strengths and challenges of your work experience. While some candidates may share personal stories that reveal their character, it is best to highlight a professional anecdote that demonstrates a positive attitude towards problem-solving. For example, you could discuss a project you successfully completed despite limited resources, or how you resolved a challenging situation that involved a difficult client or missed deadline. Sharing such experiences will show the interviewer that you are a resilient and adaptable individual.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">6) Who was your most difficult customer?</h3>
<p>The interviewer is trying to gauge your customer service experience by asking this question. You can share a personal anecdote of a time when you successfully resolved an issue with a difficult customer. Focus on how you remained composed and deescalated the situation.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">7) How do you handle a missed deadline/productivity target?</h3>
<p>The purpose of this question is to assess the candidate's honesty and ability to explain things clearly. It's important to respond truthfully to the interviewer's inquiry about why the project deadline was not met and how you dealt with any consequences that arose as a result. The interviewer is not interested in hearing about the specifics of the project.</p>
<p>It is important to carefully choose an example to share during an interview. The story you choose should be relevant, supported by facts, and presented in a positive light. Missing a deadline is never a good thing, so it's best to avoid trying to justify it. Everyone makes mistakes, and interviewers understand this. Instead, owning up to your mistake and demonstrating how you have learned from it is a more effective approach. Employers appreciate honesty and accountability, and it's impressive when potential employees take ownership of their mistakes and show a commitment to avoiding them in the future.</p>
<p>It's important to be truthful and provide an explanation when answering behavioral interview questions. The STAR method, which stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result, is particularly effective. Using this method involves describing a specific situation, the task or challenge presented, the action taken to resolve it, and the eventual outcome.</p>
<p>Reword the given text to avoid plagiarism.</p>
<p>Sure! Can you please provide the content you want me to rephrase?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but what content are you referring to? Please provide more information so I can assist you better.</p>
<p><strong>The STAR method highlights specific aspects that are crucial for effective communication of experiences and skills.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Provide a different version of the same information using different words and sentence structures so that it is not copied from the original source.</li>
<li>Can you provide the original content that needs to be rephrased? Without the original content, I cannot rewrite it.</li>
<li>Can you provide me with the original content that needs to be rephrased?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes missing a deadline is not the fault of the employee, and in these situations, they can use it to their advantage and explain that the cause was something beyond their control, such as an external event. However, this is not always an option, and in those cases, it is important to focus on the outcome or what was learned from the experience and how it led to improvement.</p>
<p>If you're in charge of meeting a deadline and have acknowledged an error you made, it's important to ensure that your interviewer is left with a positive perception of you. To achieve this, conclude your response by highlighting the steps you've taken to improve and your progress towards achieving your objectives.</p>
<p>It's important to remain confident during a job interview, even if you're asked to discuss a past failure. Keep in mind that everyone has experienced setbacks at some point. Instead of dwelling on the mistake, highlight how you used it as a learning opportunity and how you've grown because of it.</p>
<p><strong>Sure! Here's a possible rephrased version:

Model Answer: 

A great way to answer this question is to start by expressing a genuine interest in the position and the company. You can say something like, "I'm really excited about the opportunity to work for [company name]. I've done some research on your mission, values, and products/services, and I think I would be a great fit for the team." This shows that you've taken the time to learn about the company and that you're not just submitting a generic application.

Next, you can highlight some of your relevant skills and experiences that make you a strong candidate for the job. For example, you might say, "I have [number of years] of experience in [relevant field], and I've developed expertise in [specific skill or area]. I'm also a quick learner and adapt well to new challenges."

Finally, you can wrap up your answer by expressing your enthusiasm for the position and your willingness to learn and grow in the role. You might say something like, "I'm really eager to contribute my skills and experience to [company name] and to learn from the talented professionals on your team. I'm confident that I can make a positive impact on the company's goals and objectives."

By combining your enthusiasm, relevant skills and experiences, and willingness to learn and grow, you'll demonstrate to the interviewer that you're a motivated and qualified candidate who would be an asset to their team.</strong></p>
<p>One time, I had been given a tight deadline to write an article for a client. I thought I could manage the article together with the tasks I was already working on, but I underestimated the time it would take me to complete it. On the day the article was due, I realised that I was not going to be able to deliver it on time. I contacted my supervisor and explained the situation to him, apologising for my mistake and asking for an extension, which he granted. I learned that it is important to be honest with oneself about one's workload and to plan with a time buffering to ensure that even if unexpected events arise, deadlines can still be met.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">8) What would you do if you found out that your closest friend at work was stealing?</h3>
<p>The purpose of this question is to gauge your commitment to both the company and your friend. The severity of the wrongdoing should be taken into account when making a decision on how to proceed.</p>
<p>The situation involves a friend who engaged in unethical behavior towards the company. As such, it would be appropriate to report this to the company. Prior to doing so, you may want to have a conversation with your friend and provide a warning about the potential consequences of their actions.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">9) If your direct manager instructed you to do something you disagreed with, how would you handle it?</h3>
<p>The interviewer is trying to gauge your ability to deal with disagreements effectively. They are also looking to assess your negotiation skills. Highlight your communication skills and show your willingness to speak up and find a solution through open communication.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">10) What would you do if you saw someone being unsafe at work?</h3>
<p>One way to answer this question in an interview is by expressing your sense of responsibility towards your own safety and that of others. You can inform the interviewer that you would take the necessary steps to prevent any hazardous situations that could lead to an accident. This includes warning the person about the potential risks associated with the job they are performing and suggesting safer ways to do the job if you know of any. If in doubt, you would seek guidance from your supervisor.</p>
