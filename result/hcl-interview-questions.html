<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p> (A 1's day work): (B 1's day work)= 2:1 
(A+B) it's 1 day work =  
Divide   in the ratio 2:1 
A's 1-day work: </p>
<p>The given information indicates that if both A and B work together, they can complete a task in 18 days. By using the formula [(AB)/(A+B)], where AB represents the total work and A and B represent their individual efficiencies, we can calculate that Aâ€™s efficiency is twice that of Bâ€™s. If we substitute this value in the formula A = (2B), we can find that A alone can complete the task in 27 days.</p>

<h2 class="h2">HCL Technical Questions</h2>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">1) Does every class have a Constructor?</h3>
<p>It is necessary for every class to have a constructor, either in the form of a parameterized or default constructor. In the absence of a user-defined constructor, the default constructor is automatically added to the code.</p>
<p>Constructor is used to perform object initialization in programming. It is specifically designed to initialize an object. The main purpose of developing constructors is to provide a way to initialize the different attributes and properties of an object.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">2) How Java enable High Performance?</h3>
<p>Java achieves high performance by utilizing a Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler. This program converts Java bytecode, which is a program containing instructions that need interpretation, into instructions that can directly be sent to the processor.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">3) Why is java considered as dynamic?</h3>
<p>Java has been designed in a way that allows it to adapt to changing environments. It has the ability to carry a large amount of runtime data that can be used to confirm and manage object access during runtime.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">4) What is joins in SQL?</h3>
<p>Joining is the process of linking multiple tables to retrieve data from different databases.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">5) Can we have Private Constructor in Java?</h3>
<p>When a developer wants to prevent other classes from instantiating an object, he/she uses a Private Constructor. This technique is particularly useful in design patterns such as Singleton and Factory Method. By restricting object creation to a single class, developers gain greater control over object interactions and the functioning of the code.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">6) Differentiate Between Primary Key and Unique Key.</h3>
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Primary Key</th>
<th>Unique Key</th>
</tr>

<tr><td>A table in a database should have only one primary key.</td>
<td>It is possible for a table to have multiple unique keys, each representing a distinct set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table.</td>


<td>A primary key is utilized to prevent the insertion of duplicate values and NULL values.</td>
<td>The statement can be rephrased as follows: A unique key in a database will prevent the insertion of duplicated values and is able to accept null values.</td>

</tr></tbody></table>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">7) Differentiate between Method Overloading and Method Overriding.</h3>
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Method Overloading</th>
<th>Method Overriding</th>
</tr>

<tr><td>One benefit of using Method Overloading is that it increases the clarity and organization of a program's code, making it easier to read and understand.</td>
<td>Method Overriding is a programming technique that involves providing a new or modified implementation of a method that already exists in the superclass. This is used to tailor the behavior of the method to the specific needs of the subclass.</td>


<td>When using Method Overloading, it's necessary to have different parameters for each method.</td>
<td>Method Overriding requires that the parameters in the overriding method are identical to those in the original method.</td>


<td>The process of overloading occurs during the compilation phase of software development.</td>
<td>The process of overriding occurs during the program's runtime.</td>


<td>When overloading a method, the return type is not a critical factor and can be the same or different from the original method.</td>
<td>Method Overriding requires that the return type should be identical.</td>


<td>Possible rephrased version: Overloading in Java allows developers to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. This feature is not limited to instance methods and can also be applied to static methods, final methods, and even private methods. However, it's worth noting that private methods can only be called within the same class, and final methods cannot be overridden by subclasses. Additionally, while static methods don't belong to any instance and can be called without creating an object, they still belong to a class and can be overloaded based on the number, order, and type of their parameters.</td>
<td>In Java, it is not possible to override a method that is static, final, and declared as private in the superclass.</td>

</tr></tbody></table>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">8) What is the purpose of finalize () method in Java?</h3>
<p>The finalize() method in Java is an important method that is similar to the main method in Java. This method is executed just before the garbage collector reclaims the object, providing a final opportunity for the object to perform any necessary cleaning activities, such as releasing any held resources or terminating open connections.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">9) Why can static method not override?</h3>
<p>When it comes to overriding methods in Java, it's not possible for a static method to override an instance method. This is because static methods are associated with the class, whereas instance methods are associated with an object. Therefore, static methods exist in the class area while instance methods exist in the heap area.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">10) What is singleton Class?</h3>
<p>A Singleton Class is a type of class that only allows one instance to be created, but it also provides the flexibility to create more instances if the requirements change.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">11) Can we override java main method?</h3>
<p>Sorry about that, here's a possible rephrased version: 

The main method in Java is a static method. Therefore, it cannot be accessed without referring to the class name. Other methods within the same class can be accessed via objects of that class, but main cannot.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">12) What is Class Cast Exception?</h3>
<p>The Java language throws a Class Cast Exception when an attempt is made to cast an object from one data type to another. It is usually permitted to cast a variable from one type to another in Java, as long as that casting occurs between compatible data types.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">13) Why polymorphism is used in Java?</h3>
<p>Polymorphism is an essential component in Java as it is used extensively in implementing inheritance. It is crucial for allowing objects with different internal structures to share a common external interface. This feature is important for developing a flexible and scalable program architecture.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">14) What is an Abstract class?</h3>
<p>An Abstract class is designed as a foundation or template for other classes, rather than being created as an object itself. It is typically marked as public or sometimes friendly.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">public abstract class class_name
		{
			//class member
		}
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">15) Can I have Private Constructor in Abstract Class?</h3>
<p>An Abstract Class is allowed to have a Private Constructor. However, this will restrict other classes from extending the Abstract Class. If another class needs to extend the Abstract Class, a static inner class can be added within it and extended instead.</p>
