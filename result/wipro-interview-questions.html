<p>Rewrite this passage in your own words to avoid directly copying the original text.</p>
<p> Explanation:   
Suppose the number of inlet pipes is A, and the number of outlet pipes is B 
A / 12 - B / 8 = 1/12 
2B - 3B = 2 
let's take A = 4 and B = 2. Then the condition will be full-filled.

<p>Provide a version of the text in your own words without changing the original message or meaning.</p>
<p> Explanation:   
If a is the speed then speed of X= a + 5 and Y = a 
Time taken by A and B will be a and a + 5 resp. 
1/a + 1/a + 5 = 1/6 ; a2 - 7a - 30 = 0  
x = -3 or x = 10. 
Time can't be negative, i.e., x =10. 
Hence the pipe  X can fill the reservoir in 10 hours, and Y can fill it in 10+5=15 hours .</p>

<div class="testanswer" id="answer22">
<p>Provide a version of the text in your own words without changing the original message or meaning.</p>
<p> Explanation:   
Total Money spent by dealer: 
(24 * 200 + 30 * 160 + 40 * 120) = 14400 
For first 2 quantity, (24 * 200) + (30 * 160) = 9600 
He gets 20% profit by selling first two items= 1920,  
The total amount will be 9600+1920=11520 
so the third quantity = 14400 - 11520 = 2880 
Actual third quantity rate = 40 * 120 = 4800 
Loss suffered = (4800 - 2880) / 4800 
= 1920/4800 =  40 %</p>

<p> Explanation:   
Upstream speed of a boat = 8 - 4 = 4 km/hr 
downstream speed of a boat = 8 + 4 = 12 km/hr

<div class="testanswer" id="answer25">
<p>Provide a version of the text in your own words without changing the original message or meaning.</p>
<p> Explanation:   
Let the speed of stream be N.
Then for downstream, 10.5 + N = D 
and for upstream, 10.5 - N = &#85; 
so we get, D + &#85; = 21 
But, it takes him double as long to swim up as to swim down the river. 
2U+	&#85; = 21; &#85; = 7. Thus, 10.5 - N = 7

<p>Here's a rephrased version: These are the key features and capabilities that an operating system offers.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The functionality of an operating system involves the allocation of the computer's memory resources and the allocation of the central processing unit time between different applications and connected devices.</li>
<li>An operating system facilitates interaction between the user and the computer by providing a graphical user interface and a command line interface.</li>
<li>The operating system is responsible for providing necessary features for starting up the computer system.</li>
<li>Performing fundamental operations, such as the management of devices connected to a computer system.</li>
<li>File management is a crucial aspect of an operating system. Essentially, it involves the methods that are used to organize, retrieve, modify, and save data by the system.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">2) What is the difference between UNIQUE key and PRIMARY key constraints?</h3>
<p>The distinction between unique key and primary key constraints refers to two different types of key constraints that can be used in database design. While they are both forms of key constraints, they have distinct features and purposes.</p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>Unique key</th>
<th>Primary key</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Multiple unique keys can be included in a table.</td>
<td>It is possible for a table to have only a single primary key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It is permissible to have NULL values in a database which means that certain data entries can be left blank or without a value.</td>
<td>It is not permissible to have null values.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Having a unique data entry in a table column is crucial for maintaining accurate data in a database.</td>
<td>One use of a primary key in a database is to distinguish one record from another within a table.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In MS SQL server databases, a unique constraint creates an index that is non-clustered and ensures that every record in the column has a unique value.</td>
<td>When a primary key is defined for a table in a database, it will create a clustered index to ensure a unique identification of each record within the table.</td>
</tr>

<h3 class="h3">3) How can you delete the duplicate row in a table?</h3>
<p><strong>When there are identical rows in a table, it is important to exercise caution when retrieving records from it.</strong></p>
<p>To address this issue, we utilize the DISTINCT keyword.</p>
<p>The DISTINCT keyword is employed in combination with a SELECT statement to filter out duplicate rows and retrieve only unique records.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<p>One way to remove duplicate records from a table is through the use of a specific syntax.</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Reword the following passage to avoid plagiarism:

To obtain only unique results, the command "SELECT DISTINCT" is used to select columns 1 through N without any duplicates.</li>
<li>Reworded: Retrieve information from a specified table in a database.</li>

<h3 class="h3">6) What is a process and what is a thread?</h3>
<p>A thread is the smallest unit of processing and functions as a lightweight sub-process. Essentially, it is an independent path of execution.</p>
<p>Threads work independently of each other, so any errors or exceptions that occur in one thread do not have an impact on the others. They share a common memory space to perform their respective tasks.</p>
<p>The process can be complex and may involve several threads, but it is only a small component of the overall program.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">7) What are the advantages of a thread? How does the multithreading look like?</h3>
<p><strong>The subsequent are the benefits of a Thread:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Efficient communication is facilitated by it.</li>
<li>One benefit of using multitasking in computing is reducing the amount of time spent switching between different tasks, as it allows the computer to execute multiple tasks simultaneously.</li>
<li>Thread allows us to achieve concurrency in a process.</li>
<li>Using threads in programming can make better use of multi-processor systems in terms of both scale and efficiency.</li>
<li>A process which executes multiple threads simultaneously is known as <strong>multithreading</strong>.</li>
<li>A thread is a small unit of processing, which functions as a sub-process that is lightweight in nature.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>There are two methods available in Java to accomplish multitasking.</strong></p>
<p>Multiprocessing and multithreading</p>
<p>Multithreading refers to a programming technique where a single process can consist of more than one thread and can execute multiple threads simultaneously.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">8) What are Multi-Processing and Multitasking?</h3>
<p>Multitasking involves the simultaneous running of several tasks on a single CPU. It is employed to make the most efficient use of the CPU's resources.</p>
<p><strong>There are two methods of achieving multitasking.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing)</li>
<li>Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading)</li>
</ul>
<p>The term multi-processing refers to a system's capability to concurrently operate and utilize more than one CPU.</p>
<p>Multithreading refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads (or pathways of execution) concurrently. This means that multiple tasks can be run simultaneously within the same program.</p>

<h3 class="h3">9) What are stack and Queue and its applications?</h3>
<h3 class="h4">Stack</h3>
<ol class="points">
<li>The stack is an ordered list in which, insertion and deletion can be performed only at one end that is called a <strong>top</strong>.</li>
<li>The stack is a type of data structure that is designed in a recursive manner. It contains a reference to its highest element.</li>
<li>Stacks are known for their Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the element that enters first in the stack will be the last one to be removed.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Applications of Stack:</strong></p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Recursion</li>
<li>Rewritten: 

The process of analyzing and converting expressions is known as expression evaluations and conversions.</li>
<li>Parsing</li>
<li>Browsers</li>
<li>Editors</li>
<li>Tree Traversals</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="h4">Queue</h3>
<ol class="points">
<li>A queue can be defined as an ordered list which enables insert operations to be performed at one end called <strong>REAR</strong> and delete operations to be performed at another end called FRONT.</li>
<li>The concept of a queue involves the principle of First-In-First-Out, where items or data added to the queue are processed or removed in the same order they were added.</li>
<li>An instance of a queue can be seen when a group of individuals line up to purchase a train ticket.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Applications of Queue:</strong></p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Queues are commonly utilized as a means of creating waitlists for the purpose of accessing a single shared resource, such as a CPU, disk or printer.</li>
<li>The utilization of queues is commonly seen in the asynchronous transmission of data in situations where the rate of data transfer is not uniform between two processes. Some examples of such situations include file IO, sockets, and pipes.</li>
<li>Buffering is a commonly used technique in various applications including music players like MP3 and CD players. These applications often rely on queues to store and retrieve information effectively.</li>
<li>Queues play a crucial role in media players as they help manage the playlist by enabling users to add or remove songs from the list.</li>
<li>Operating systems rely on queues to manage interrupts efficiently.</li>

<h3 class="h3">10) What is indexing, what are the advantages and disadvantages of it?</h3>
<p>Indexes are unique tables that enable quick data retrieval from a database. They facilitate faster searching, sorting, and filtering of data.</p>
<p>An Index is a tool used to enhance the speed of select queries and where clauses, but it could possibly hinder performance when inserting or updating data. Creating or dropping indexes can be done without altering the data in any way.</p>
<p>An analogy can be made between a database index and an index found at the back of a book.</p>
<p>Indexing is categorisation or sorting of data, documents or information based on certain criteria such as relevance, subject matter, date, or other relevant factors. There are different types of indexing methods.</p>
<p>The following paragraphs discuss types of indexes used in databases. These include primary indexes, secondary indexes, and clustering indexes. A primary index is a type of index used to organize data in a database, which is based on a unique identifier. A secondary index can be used to provide an additional method of accessing data in a database, which is different from the primary index. Finally, clustering indexes are useful for optimizing database performance by grouping related data together.</p>
<p><strong>The benefits of using indexes include:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>An index aids in the quick retrieval of data.</li>
<li>Queries benefit greatly from the utilization of indexes, as it significantly improves their performance.</li>
<li>One potential benefit of using hash tables is their ability to perform sorting without the need for a separate post-fetch-sort operation, potentially saving time and resources.</li>
<li>An index provides a way to efficiently retrieve records from a database and ensures each record has a distinct identifier.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Possible rephrased version: There are some drawbacks or limitations associated with using indexes.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Creating indexes can negatively impact the performance of inserting, updating, or deleting data in a database.</li>
<li>Indexes require storage space, which can vary in size depending on the number and length of the fields used.</li>
<li>Indexed fields in databases are formatted in a uniform case for the values they contain.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">11) What is De-Normalization where does it have?</h3>
<p>Denormalization is an optimization technique used to enhance the performance of databases by adding redundant data and minimizing complex data. It is a technique that aims to simplify database elements and eliminate the need for expensive joins, thus providing better database performance.</p>
<p>Denormalization is a step that follows normalization. It involves adding redundant data to a normalized database for the purpose of avoiding expensive joins. The aim of normalization is to remove redundancies in data, and denormalization adds back some of the same redundancies based on the specific needs of the database.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">12) What are the Different Objects in DBMS?</h3>
<p>A database object is a unit of data storage or reference within a database. These objects are typically created using the CREATE command and allow for data to be organized and stored in a specific way within the database.</p>
<p>There are various categories of objects that can exist in a database management system (DBMS).</p>
<p>The View object is utilized to establish a database view. It is essentially a virtual table that takes its data from another view or base table, serving as a filter to display structured data the way it is required. The original table on which the view is created is known as a base table.</p>
<p>To add a table in a database, we can utilize the CREATE TABLE statement.</p>
<p>The 'sequence' command is utilized to create a sequence within a database. This particular object is created by users and can be shared among multiple users in order to generate distinct integers.</p>
<p>An index is a tool used by a database object to create indexes in a database. Its primary purpose is to retrieve rows quickly from a table.</p>
<p>This particular item is utilized for generating indexes within the database. Synonyms can be employed to conveniently access the objects.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">13) What are Self-Join and Outer Join, where do you use it?</h3>
<p>A self-join is a type of database join where a table is joined with itself. This means that each row in the table is combined with every other row in the same table. Typically, a self-join involves a foreign key that references the table's primary key.</p>
<p>The table illustrates a one-to-many relationship, which is also referred to as a unary relationship.</p>
<p>When using SQL outer join, the information from both tables is combined, regardless of whether there are any matches between them. This allows all of the data to be integrated together, including that which may not have corresponding data in the other table.</p>
<p>There are two variants of outer join:</p>
<p>A left outer join, commonly referred to as a left join, is a type of join that combines all the rows from the left table with the matching rows from the right table. In cases where there are no matching rows in the right table, the join returns NULL values.</p>
<p><strong>Rewritten: One way to combine data from two tables in a SQL database is through a left outer join. This type of join returns all the rows from the left table and only matching rows from the right table. It's a useful tool for showing all the data from one table, even if there's no corresponding data in the other table.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>SELECT</strong> table1.column1, table2.column2..... </li>
<li><strong>FROM</strong> table1 </li>
<li>LEFTJOIN table2 </li>
<li><strong>ON</strong> table1.column_field = table2.column_field;</li>
</ul>
<p>A right outer join, also referred to as a right join, is a type of database join where all the rows from the right table are included in the result set, along with any matching rows from the left table. If there are no matching values in the left table, the result will still include the corresponding row from the right table, but with null values.</p>
<p><strong>Here is an example of the fundamental structure used for performing right joins in programming.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>SELECT</strong> table1.column1, table2.column2.....</li>
<li><strong>FROM</strong> table1 </li>
<li>Reword the following text to avoid plagiarism:

"Use of the RIGHT JOIN function with table2."</li>
<li><strong>ON</strong> table1.column_field = table2.column_field; </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3">15) Explain some differences between TRUNCATE and DELETE commands with their syntax?</h3>
<p>Deletion and truncation statements have slight differences. The DELETE statement deletes rows in a table based on the condition defined in the WHERE clause or removes all rows when no condition is specified.</p>
<p>The DROP TABLE command removes a table from a database but it does not release the space previously used by the table.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="html">
DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE condition];  
</textarea></div>
<p>In MySQL, the DELETE statement is used to remove data from a table. However, it's important to note that if you don't specify a WHERE condition, the DELETE statement will delete all the rows in the table. This could have serious consequences, so it's crucial to be mindful when using the DELETE statement.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="html">
DELETE FROM table_name;
</textarea></div>
<p>The TRUNCATE statement is a command used to remove all the data rows from a table in a database system. It also frees up the space occupied by the data rows.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="html">

<h3 class="h3">16) Define memory management in C.</h3>
<p>Upon running a program, it is stored in the computer's memory and begins execution by sending and receiving instructions from the computer's processor. Functions within the program are loaded into a separate part of the memory as needed, and once the function has been executed, that memory is then released.</p>
<p>Dynamic memory allocation is an essential feature in C language that allows developers to allocate memory during runtime instead of compile-time. This is made possible through four functions in the stdlib.h header file. With dynamic memory allocation, programmers can manage memory space more efficiently and create more flexible and dynamic programs.</p>

<h3 class="h3">17) What are the steps involved in designing complete software?</h3>
<p>If a software needs to be developed, it is important for a programmer to abide by the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</p>
<p>The software development life cycle pertains to the process of creating new software.</p>
<p><strong>The SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) consists of six main stages or steps.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Planning</strong>: Plan about the scope, approach, functionalities, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Requirement analysis</strong>: Gather the required tools, data, and information that are required for the project</li>
<li><strong>Designing</strong>: Design a prototype to check the architecture of the project.</li>
<li><strong>Coding</strong>: coding as per designing.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong>: testing is done to check whether the actual result meets the required result.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance</strong>: Updates</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3">18) What is the difference between Abstract classes and interface?</h3>
<p>To implement a Java interface, the appropriate keyword to use is "implements". On the other hand, if you want to extend a Java abstract class, you should use the keyword "extends".</p>
<p>In Java, interfaces can only extend other interfaces, while abstract classes can extend only one class but can implement multiple interfaces at once.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">19) What is the property of a class?</h3>
<p>In programming, a property is a characteristic of a class that allows access to an object or attribute. This can include the length of a string, the size of a font, the title of a window, the name of a user, and more.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">20) Define precondition and postcondition to a member function.</h3>
<p>A pre-condition refers to a requirement that needs to be fulfilled before a method can execute properly.</p>
<p>A post-condition refers to a particular condition that a method must ensure is true after it has completed execution.</p>
<p>If all the requirements necessary for using a particular method are adequately met, the outcomes or results expected from such a method will also be successfully achieved.</p>
<p>There is no assurance for the expected conduct or outcome if the pre-existing conditions aren't met.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">21) How can you sort the elements of an array in ascending order?</h3>
<p>Here's a possible rephrased version:

We can write a C program that sorts the elements in an array in ascending order. This means arranging the items from smallest to largest. By performing this operation, we can quickly locate the smallest or largest value in the array or produce output in a more readable or meaningful format.</p>

<h3 class="h3">29) Name the operators that can't be overloaded.</h3>
<p>It is not possible to overload certain operators in programming. Here are some examples of these operators.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The Scope Resolution operator (::) is a symbol used to access a class's static members, constants, and overridden functions. It specifies the scope in which the member is defined or the class in which it is defined.</li>
<li>Pointer-to-member Operator (.*)</li>
<li>One possible way to rephrase the content without plagiarizing it could be:

The dot operator (.) is also known as Member Access.</li>
<li>Reword the following text to avoid plagiarism:

"The ternary or conditional operator (?:) allows for a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement in a single line of code."</li>
<li>The sizeof operator is used for determining the size of an object in memory.</li>
<li>The "typeid" operator is used in C++ to determine the data type of an object.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">30) What is polymorphism?</h3>
<p>Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows a single name to have multiple forms. This means that a single function or method can take on different meanings depending on the context in which it is used.</p>
<p>Polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to exhibit different behaviors depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Polymorphism can be categorized into two distinct types.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Compile time polymorphism</strong>: It is known as <strong>method overloading</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime polymorphism</strong>: it is also known as <strong>method overriding</strong>.</li>

<h3 class="h3">31) How is C++ struct different from C++ class?</h3>
<p>A struct refers to a collection of related elements that are grouped together to work in a specific context. It is useful in situations where there is a limited number of arguments that can be passed to a function.</p>
<p>If you don't provide an access modifier for the members of a struct or class, their visibility will default to public in the case of a struct and private in the case of a class.</p>
<p>By default, the visibility of a struct in C++ extends slightly beyond its members. In terms of inheritance, if no access specifier is provided, the struct will inherit publicly from its base class, whereas a class will inherit privately.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">32) What is DOM?</h3>
<p>The acronym DOM refers to Document Object Model. It is a software interface designed for handling HTML and XML documents. This API furnishes a means of constructing the document's logical structure and facilitates access to and alteration of the document.</p>
<p>DOM, or Document Object Model, is a structure that hierarchically represents a table.</p>

<h3 class="h3">34) What Is The List Interface?</h3>
<p>The List Interface is a subinterface of Collection that enables inserting and deleting elements based on index. It also creates a List-Iterator interface. Unlike other interfaces, Lists can contain duplicate items. It provides various operations for the purpose of manipulating Lists.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Positional Access</strong>: Manipulate elements based on their numerical position in the list.</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong>: Search for specified objects in the list and return its numerical position.</li>
<li><strong>List Iteration</strong>: Extend Iterator semantics to take advantage of the list's sequential nature.</li>
<li><strong>Range-view</strong>: Perform arbitrary range operations on the list.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">35) What Is The Vector Class?</h3>
<p>The Vector class is based on the List interface and preserves the order of its elements when they are inserted. While the ArrayList and Vector classes share similarities, there are some distinctions between the two.</p>
<p>When working in a multi-threaded environment, Vector's synchronization causes it to be slower because it holds other threads in a runnable or non-runnable state until the current thread releases the lock on the object. This means that Vector is not as efficient when it comes to concurrent processing.</p>
<p><strong>The Vector class is considered a legacy class.</strong></p>
<p>If the total number of elements in an array exceeds its capacity and there is a 100% increment in the vector, then the array size will be doubled.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">36) What is an Iterator Interface?</h3>
<p>An iterator in Java is an interface that provides methods for accessing elements of a collection. It's used for iteration purposes and allows developers to traverse through the items in a collection one by one.</p>
<p>To generate an iterator object, use the iterator() method found in the collection interface.</p>
<p><strong>Sure, here's a rephrased version:

The interface defines a set of methods that can be implemented by a class. These methods provide a way for the class to interact with other parts of the program or system. The specific methods required by an interface will depend on the specific needs of the program or system, and can be customized to suit those needs. Implementing an interface can help make a class more flexible and adaptable, as it provides a way to change the behavior of the class without changing its structure or dependencies.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The function `hasNext()` is used to determine whether there are any remaining elements in a collection that can be accessed.</li>
<li>The Python method "next()" is used to retrieve the next element in the sequence.</li>
<li>Reworded: The remove() method can be used to eliminate the current element from the collection, but it's recommended to avoid its usage in certain scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">37) What is the major difference between yield () and sleep ()?</h3>
<p>The Java programming language has two variations of the Sleep() method. The first variant of the method allows for the input of the sleeping time in milliseconds, while the second variant allows for the input of both milliseconds and nanoseconds for the duration of the sleep.</p>
<p>"The Yield() method allows currently executing threads to pause and allows other threads or processes that are ready to run to execute. If there are no other threads available to run, the current thread will resume execution."</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">38) What Are Wrapped Classes?</h3>
<p>In Java, there is a wrapper class that enables the conversion of primitive data types into objects and vice versa. These wrapper classes are comprised of eight classes within the java.lang package.</p>

<h3 class="h3">39) What is garbage collection? Does it guarantee that a program will not run out of memory?</h3>
<p><strong>Garbage collection:</strong></p>
<p>Garbage Collection is an automatic procedure that helps in freeing up memory that is not in use. It aids in removing objects that are no longer needed, and thus, makes the program more efficient.</p>
<p>In programming languages like C and C++, developers need to manually manage memory allocation and deallocation using functions like free() and delete(). However, in Java, memory management is handled automatically without the need for these functions. As a result, Java is considered to provide more efficient and effective memory management compared to other programming languages.</p>
<p>There are situations where programs consume memory resources at a faster pace compared to when the garbage collection takes place. Additionally, it's possible to create objects in a program that aren't subject to garbage collection, which further adds to the challenge of maintaining enough memory. It's important to note that while garbage collection helps manage memory, it doesn't provide a guarantee that a program won't experience memory shortages.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">40) What is the Name of the immediate superclass of the Applet class?</h3>

<p>A semicolon ";" should always be used at the end of a native method declaration because it already has an implementation provided. Additionally, it is important to note that this type of modifier cannot be applied to classes or objects.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">42) What are the collections API?</h3>
<p>The Java Collection is a set of tools that allows coders to manage and manipulate collections of objects. It provides a structure that enables the storage and manipulation of a group of objects.</p>
<p>Java Collections provide a variety of functions that allow you to perform essential operations on data, including sorting, searching, insertion, deletion, and manipulation. These tools provide a comprehensive toolset for managing data effectively.</p>
<p>The Java Collection framework consists of interfaces such as Set, List, Queue, Deque, etc., and classes such as ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet, and more. These interfaces and classes collectively form a unit of objects that can be used in Java programming.</p>
<p><strong>Collection framework has:</strong></p>

<h3 class="h3">48) What are the major differences between preemptive scheduling and time slicing?</h3>
<p><strong>Preemptive scheduling: </strong></p>
<p>Primitive scheduling involves executing the task with the highest priority until it transitions to another state such as waiting or being terminated, or until a higher priority task emerges.</p>
<p><strong>Time slicing:</strong></p>
<p>The concept of time slicing refers to a scheduling strategy where tasks are executed for a predetermined amount of time, before being placed back in the queue of tasks to be completed later. The scheduling process then determines which task should be executed next, taking into account factors such as priority. This approach effectively manages the allocation of resources and ensures that every task is given a fair chance to complete.</p>

<p>The concept of associativity is employed to ensure that expressions are evaluated in an orderly manner, either from left-to-right or right-to-left.</p>
<p><Strong>Order of precedence example: </Strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
(5 > 2 + 5 && 4)
</textarea></div>
<p>Reword the text to avoid copying the original phrase or sentence structure while conveying the same meaning.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
((5 > (2 + 5)) && 4)
</textarea></div>
<p> The expression (2 + 5) will executes first and the result will be 7 
Then after first part of the expression (5 > 7) executes and gives 0 (false) as an output 
Finally, (0 && 4) executes and gives 0 (false).</p>
<p><Strong>Associativity: </Strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
4 * 2 / 4
</textarea></div>
<p>In the given expression, the operators '*' and '/' have equal precedence and follow left-to-right associativity. This means that the calculation begins from the expression on the left and proceeds towards the right.</p>
<p>The content is a straightforward mathematical expression, which cannot be plagiarized as it is a formula used in many different contexts. However, if there is surrounding text that has been copied from another source, it should be rewritten in your own words and properly cited to avoid plagiarism.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
((4 * 2) / 4)
i.e., (4 * 2) executes first and the result will be 8 (true)
then, (8 / 4) executes and the final output will be 2 (true)

The final question asked in an interview, whether it is a technical or HR interview, is typically a closing one. It signifies that the interview is coming to an end and allows the interviewer to gather any final thoughts or impressions from the candidate.</p>
<p>Please provide me with a response in the affirmative while also posing a thoughtful question that can persuade the interviewer to consider advancing my candidacy to the following stage.</p>
<p>Can you provide an example of what the next round would be like?</p>
<p>Can you provide information about any necessary agreements or contracts that we would be required to sign?</p>

<h3 class="h3">18) If anybody doesn't cooperate with your team what are the steps you would take.</h3>
<p>Dealing with problematic employees in a team can have serious implications on organizational productivity and customer satisfaction. It can lead to a decrease in work efficiency, increased frustration and a negative impact on customer experiences.</p>
<p>Here are some steps you can take to manage team members who are causing difficulties:</p>
<p>One should not overlook the issue of problematic staff as it often leads to the manager ignoring the situation, which is not a viable solution. Therefore, it is important to address the problem rather than avoiding it.</p>
<p> Intervene as soon as possible:  This problem affects the production, hence should have to take action as soon as possible. The manager needs to gather information from an employee that what is the reason behind it, and personally analyze the issue.
</p><p>To address the problem effectively, the manager should personally connect with the employee. They need to find a quiet place like a conference room or office, away from others, to identify the root cause of the problem.</p>
<p>The responsibility of a manager is to determine whether or not their employee is aware of an issue. If the employee is unaware, it is the manager's duty to inform them about the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Assist employees facing difficulties to get back on the right path by offering support and guidance.</strong></p>
<p>When an employee is made aware of their negative behavior by their manager, they may begin to realize that it's a real problem that others are experiencing, and that it's not in line with the values of the organization. At this point, the employee will likely try to correct their behavior and start thinking about what's best for the organization.</p>
<p><strong>If all other options have been exhausted, it may be necessary to consider termination as a potential outcome.</strong></p>
<p>If an employee consistently displays negative behavior and refuses to cooperate despite efforts to improve, termination may be necessary.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">19) Are you willing to relocate?</h3>
<p>Wipro is a well-known and expanding organization with a significant presence in over 175 cities, delivering services to its clients. It is evident that no employee would want to depart from such a large and dynamic enterprise easily.</p>
<p>Sure! Here's a rephrased version:

There are two ways to approach the question of willingness to relocation. One option is to answer affirmatively, indicating that you are open to following company requirements and working with the team in a new location.</p>
<p>Here is a possible rephrased version:

If you prefer to stay in your current location, it's best not to directly reject the possibility of relocation during a job interview. Instead, you can explain that you have strong ties to your community and would like to continue living there, while also acknowledging the potential benefits of the position you're interviewing for. A good way to express this could be: "While I have deep roots in this city and would ideally prefer to stay, I'm excited about the prospect of working for this company and I wouldn't want to miss out on this opportunity. If relocation is necessary, I'm definitely open to considering it." This shows that you're both committed to your current location and adaptable to new circumstances, which can reflect positively on you as a job candidate.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">20) Are you comfortable with working over weekends?</h3>
<p>Wipro is a renowned multinational company and according to my personal decision, I will always make myself available whenever the company needs me, including during night shifts or weekends. I believe that the growth of the company is directly linked to the growth of its employees. Based on my observations, I am confident in the potential of this organization to succeed in the long-term.</p>
<p>To achieve a positive outcome, it's essential to work in collaboration with the company.</p>
<p>The following is an example of a plagiarized content that needs to be rephrased:

Original: "I love watching movies on Netflix. Their library has a wide range of genres to choose from, and the convenience of being able to stream them anytime makes it my go-to platform for entertainment."

Rephrased: "Netflix is my preferred platform for entertainment because of its extensive library of movies categorized into various genres, and the convenience of streaming options available at any time is a plus. I enjoy spending my leisure time watching my favourite movies on this platform."</p>
