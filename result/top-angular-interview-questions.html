<h1 class="h1">Angular Interview Questions and Answers</h1>
<h3 class="h3">1) What is Angular? / What do you know about Angular?</h3>
<p>Angular is a widely used JavaScript framework that was created and is now supported by Google. The framework is designed for front-end web development and relies on TypeScript. One of Angularâ€™s primary advantages is its ability to facilitate the development of maintainable and reusable code, making it particularly well-suited to enterprise applications.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">2) What are some powerful features integrated into Angular?</h3>
<p>The integration of Angular brings several useful features that simplify the development process, including declarative templates, end-to-end tooling, dependency injection, and various other effective methodologies. Overall, the platform provides a robust framework for building powerful web applications.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">3) What is the main purpose of Angular?</h3>
<p>Angular is a widely used tool for building web applications that are highly responsive, scalable, and efficient. With Angular, developers can create dynamic web applications quickly using components and directives, which simplifies the development process considerably. The advantage of using Angular is that it allows developers to create complex applications without worrying about performance, as it comes loaded with significant optimization features to ensure better user experience and faster load times.</p>
<p>Angular was initially created as a framework for developing SPA (Single-Page-Application) and has since then expanded to include dynamic content which permits customization for various users, using the dependency injection technique. With its versatile programming, it becomes effortless for developers to create cross-platform applications and enhance the front end of web-based applications. A great demonstration of this framework's power is exhibited in YouTubeTV, which uses Angular to deliver its features efficiently.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">4) What is the difference between AngularJS and Angular?</h3>
<p>Here is a comparison of the main characteristics of AngularJS and Angular in a tabular format:</p>
<p><strong>Here are some ways you can differentiate between AngularJS and Angular:</strong></p>
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>AngularJS</th>
<th>Angular</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Version</strong></td>
<td>AngularJS, which was introduced in 2010, was the first version of the JavaScript framework used for developing web applications within HTML code. Its impact on web app development was significant, leading it to become commonly referred to by its nickname, AngularJS.</td>
<td>Angular went through a major overhaul with the release of Angular 2 in 2016, as it was a complete rewrite of AngularJS. The only similarity between the two was that they were developed by the same core team. Subsequent versions were released, including Angular 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, which are all quite similar. These later versions are collectively referred to as simply Angular, with AngularJS being a separate entity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Architecture</strong></td>
<td>AngularJS has the ability to implement the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.</td>
<td>Angular is a web development framework that uses building blocks known as components and directives to create interactive web applications. These components and directives are key elements of the Angular architecture and provide developers with a way to create reusable and modular parts of a web application. Components are responsible for defining the user interface of an application, while directives help to enhance the functionality of the components.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Supported Language</strong></td>
<td>AngularJS has a recommended and officially supported programming language, which is JavaScript.</td>
<td>TypeScript is the officially recommended and supported language for Angular development. This means that it's the language that the Angular team suggests using for building web applications with their framework.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Expression Syntax</strong></td>
<td>To add an image or property and an event in AngularJS, you will need to use a particular ng directive.</td>
<td>In Angular, the process of binding events is achieved using parentheses (), while binding properties is done using square brackets [].</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Mobile Support</strong></td>
<td>AngularJS doesn't come with any built-in capabilities to support mobile devices.</td>
<td>Angular is a framework that offers support for the development of mobile applications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Dependency Injection</strong></td>
<td>AngularJS does not incorporate the idea of Dependency Injection.</td>
<td>Angular facilitates a hierarchical Dependency Injection mechanism with one-way tree-shaped change detection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Routing</strong></td>
<td>In AngularJS, developers configure routing by making use of $routeprovider.when().</td>
<td>Angular uses @RouteConfig for configuring routing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Structure</strong></td>
<td>The initial edition of the system is a simple and uncomplicated version, making it highly manageable even for beginners.</td>
<td>Its structure is highly simplified, making the development and upkeep of large applications incredibly straightforward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Speed</strong></td>
<td>The tool's speed is negatively impacted due to the fact that it has only a small number of features available for use.</td>
<td>TypeScript, the upgraded version of JavaScript which is used in Angular 2 and above, enables Angular to run faster than its predecessor, AngularJS. The enhanced features of TypeScript make Angular more efficient and helps in improving the overall performance of an application.</td>
</tr>

<h3 class="h3">5) What are the biggest advantages of using Angular?</h3>
<p>The Angular framework has a number of significant benefits for developers. Some of the most notable advantages include:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The capability of two-way data-binding is present in Angular programming language.</li>
<li>The framework utilizes the widely recognized MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for its design.</li>
<li>The software allows users to create both static templates and Angular templates.</li>
<li>This feature enables the addition of a personalized directive.</li>
<li>The framework boasts of its compatibility with various Java enterprise technologies and its ability to support RESTful services.</li>
<li>Angular has the capability to support validations.</li>
<li>Angular facilitates the exchange of information between the client and server sides of an application.</li>
<li>Dependency injection is a functionality that is catered to by this system to provide assistance with support.</li>
<li>This software has many advanced capabilities, such as the ability to create Event Handlers and Animations.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">6) What do you understand by Angular expressions? How are Angular expressions different from JavaScript expressions? </h3>
<p>Angular expressions are small pieces of code that are utilized in binding application data to HTML. These expressions are resolved by Angular, and the outcome is then returned to the section where the expression has been written. Angular expressions are commonly denoted by wrapping them within double braces: {{ expression }}, much like JavaScript syntax.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<p>{{ expression }}</p>
<p>The following is a comparison of Angular expressions and JavaScript expressions, highlighting their differences:</p>
<p>The key distinction between Angular expressions and JavaScript expressions is that the former permits injecting JavaScript code into HTML, whereas the latter does not.</p>
<p>Angular expressions differ from JavaScript expressions in the way they are evaluated. Angular expressions are evaluated within the local scope object while JavaScript expressions are evaluated in the global window object. Let's say we have a component called "test" to illustrate this point.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
selector: 'app-test',
template: `
&lt;h4&gt;{{message}}&lt;/h4&gt;,
styleUrls: ['./test.component.css']
})
export class TestComponent implements OnInit {
message:string = ?Hello world?;
constructor() { }
ngOnInit() {
}
}
</textarea></div>
<p>This passage discusses how Angular expressions are used in templates to display certain information. Specifically, it notes that these expressions are evaluated based on the local scope of the component, rather than the global scope. This means that properties can only be accessed and displayed if they are within the component's local scope.</p>
<p>Angular expressions have a feature that allows them to handle null and undefined values, unlike JavaScript expressions which do not have this capability.</p>
<p>Please provide the original JavaScript example content so that it can be rephrased.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">      &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
      &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
          &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
          &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
          &lt;title&gt;JavaScript Test&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
          &lt;div id="foo"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;script&gt;
          'use strict';
          let bar = {};
          document.getElementById('foo').innerHTML = bar.x;
      &lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
</textarea></div>
<p>The output of the code above is "undefined," which is not an ideal result to display to the user. While it's important to avoid leaving any properties undefined, it's not necessary to show this to the user.</p>
<p>Take a look at the following example in Angular programming language:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">      import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
      @Component({
        selector: 'app-new',
        template: `
            &lt;h4&gt;{{message}}&lt;/h4&gt;       `,
        styleUrls: ['./new.component.css']
      })
      export class NewComponent implements OnInit {
        message:object = {};
        constructor() { }
        ngOnInit() {
        }
      }
</textarea></div>
<p>The preceding instance indicated that the outcome displayed on the screen will not be undefined.</p>
<p>Angular expressions cater to a unique set of features not found in other expressions. Unlike standard expressions, Angular expressions offer pipes, which are used to modify data before displaying content. Loops, conditionals, and exceptions are not supported in Angular expressions.</p>
<p>See this example:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
      @Component({
        selector: 'app-new',
        template: `
            &lt;h4&gt;{{message | lowercase}}&lt;/h4&gt;,
        styleUrls: ['./new.component.css']
      })
      export class NewComponent implements OnInit {
        message:string = "HELLO JAVATPOINT";
        constructor() { }
        ngOnInit() {
        }
      } 
</textarea></div>
<p>The previous example involves the use of a pre-existing pipe known as lowercase, which changes all the letters to lowercase format. Once executed, the outcome will display as "hello javatpoint".</p>
<p>Unlike Elixir, JavaScript does not incorporate the idea of pipes.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">7) What are templates in Angular?</h3>
<p>Angular templates are crafted using HTML elements and attributes, which are combined with data from the model and controller. This process yields dynamic views that are presented to the user. The elements and attributes used within the template are specific to Angular and tailored to meet its requirements.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">8) What is the difference between an Annotation and a Decorator in Angular?</h3>
<p>In Angular, annotations and decorators play important roles in modifying and enhancing the behavior of a class. Annotations use the Reflect Metadata library to create an array of metadata for a class, while decorators are design patterns that allow for modifications to a class without altering the original source code.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">9) Why was Angular introduced as a client-side framework?</h3>
<p>Before the inception of Angular, web developers used VanillaJS and jQuery to create interactive websites. However, as websites became more complex with the addition of numerous features, maintaining the code became unmanageable. Moreover, jQuery didn't offer any data handling features across views. This created a requirement for a client-side framework such as Angular that could simplify the lives of developers by keeping separation of concerns in mind and dividing the code into smaller components.</p>
<p>Angular is a popular client-side framework that makes it easier for developers to create complex web applications such as Single-Page-Applications. While it is possible to develop such applications using VanillaJS, this is a more time-consuming process.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">10) How does an Angular application work?</h3>
<p>The angular.json file is an essential part of every Angular application as it contains all the app configurations. During the building process, the builder refers to this file to identify the entry point of the application. Thus, it's important to have a proper understanding of this file's structure to efficiently configure an Angular app.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">      "build": {
        "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser",
        "options": {
          "outputPath": "dist/angular-starter",
          "index": "src/index.html",
          "main": "src/main.ts",
          "polyfills": "src/polyfills.ts",
          "tsConfig": "tsconfig.app.json",
          "aot": false,
          "assets": [
            "src/favicon.ico",
            "src/assets"
          ],
          "styles": [
            "./node_modules/@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/deeppurple-amber.css",
            "src/style.css"
          ]
        }
      }
</textarea></div>
<p>During the build stage of an application, there is a configuration object with the options that define how the application will behave. The application's main entry point is typically main.ts which sets up the environment for browser to run and initializes the application by calling the bootstrapModule function. </p>
<p>The main.ts file executes two steps, which are performed in a particular sequence. The first step involves the implementation of a data analysis algorithm. The second step involves the visualization of the analyzed data.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule) 
</textarea></div>
<p>The given line of code is responsible for bootstrapping AppModule. It initiates the process of initializing the application module.</p>
<p>In the app.module.ts file, there is a module called AppModule which contains declarations for various components used in the application. All the components are declared in this module.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a potential app.module.ts file as an example.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java"> import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
      import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
      import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
      @NgModule({
        declarations: [
          AppComponent
        ],
        imports: [
          BrowserModule
        ],
        providers: [],
        entryComponents: [],
        bootstrap: [AppComponent]
      })
      export class AppModule { }
</textarea></div>
<p>The file shared above showcases that the bootstrapping process of Angular's AppComponent is being executed. This component is defined in another file called app.component.ts, which plays a crucial role in the communication between the webpage and the data it displays.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a sample code snippet of a file named app.component.ts.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">import { Component } from '@angular/core';
      @Component({
        selector: 'app-root',
        templateUrl: './app.component.html',
        styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
      })
      export class AppComponent {
        title = 'angular';
      }
</textarea></div>
<p>The declaration of every component involves specifying three distinct properties:</p>
<ol class="points">
<li><strong>Selector -</strong> It is used to access the component.</li>
<li><strong>Template/TemplateURL -</strong> It contains HTML of the component.</li>
<li><strong>StylesURL -</strong> It contains component-specific stylesheets.</li>
</ol>
<p>Angular begins by reading the contents of the index.html file. This file is responsible for calling the root component, which is called app-root. The definition of this root component can be found in the app.component.ts file.</p>
<p><strong>Can you please provide me with the content that you want me to rephrase?</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">    &lt;!doctype html&gt;
      &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Angular&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;base href="/"&gt;
        &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;app-root&gt;&lt;/app-root&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
</textarea></div>
<p>The &lt;app-root&gt; tags contain the HTML template of the root component in an Angular application. This is a standard approach followed by every Angular application.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">11) Why is Angular preferred over other frameworks? / What are some advantages of Angular over other frameworks?</h3>
<p>Angular is the preferred framework over others due to its distinct features.</p>
<p>Angular is an exceptional framework that offers developers a range of pre-built functions, including routing, state management, HTTP services, RxJS library, and dependency injection. This eliminates the need for developers to search for these features individually.</p>
<p>Angular features declarative UI, where the user interface is created using HTML as the primary language. This approach is more straightforward to utilize than JavaScript, as it defines what the UI should look like instead of focusing on how to achieve it programmatically.</p>
<p>Google offers long-term support for Angular as it is their own development and maintenance. Hence, they are committed to sticking with Angular and providing continuous assistance.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">12) What are the different Lifecycle hooks of Angular? Explain them in short.</h3>
<p>The Angular components go through a series of phases during their lifecycle, starting from creation until they are destroyed. To monitor and execute changes at specific phases, Angular Lifecycle hooks are used. These hooks enable developers to check the lifecycle phase of a component and perform necessary actions accordingly.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/top-angular-interview-questions-q12.png" alt="Angular Interview questions">
<p>The "ngOnChanges()" method is utilized in Angular when there are changes in one or multiple input properties of a component. This hook accepts a SimpleChanges object which includes the previous and current values of the respective property.</p>
<p>The ngOnInit hook is the second lifecycle hook which is called once after the ngOnChanges hook. Its purpose is to initialize the component and assign values to the input properties of the component.</p>
<p>The ngDoCheck() hook is called after the ngOnChanges and ngOnInit hooks and is utilized to identify and respond to changes that Angular is unable to detect. This hook allows for the implementation of a custom change detection algorithm to be executed.</p>
<p>The ngAfterContentInit hook is triggered after the first ngDoCheck hook and serves to respond to content that has been projected into the component.</p>
<p>The ngAfterContentChecked() hook is executed after the ngAfterContentInit() hook and every ngDoCheck() thereafter. It specifically responds after verifying the projected content.</p>
<p>The ngAfterViewInit() hook is executed when a component's view has been initialized or when the view of a child component has been initialized.</p>
<p>The hook ngAfterViewChecked() is triggered once the ngAfterViewInit() hook has been executed. This hook is responsible for responding to changes that occur in a component's view, or in the view of its child components. It fires after the component's view has been checked for updates.</p>
<p>The ngOnDestroy() hook is triggered right before Angular dismantles the component. Its primary purpose is to perform any necessary code cleanup and detach any event handlers that may have been connected during the component's lifespan.</p>
<p>The ngOnInit hook is commonly used in Angular and is particularly useful for processing large amounts of data during component creation. It is recommended to use this hook over the constructor for such tasks.</p>
<p><strong>See the example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">      import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
      @Component({
        selector: 'app-test',
        templateUrl: './test.component.html',
        styleUrls: ['./test.component.css']
      })
      export class TestComponent implements OnInit {
        constructor() { }
        ngOnInit() {
          this.processData();
        }
        processData(){
          // Do something..
        }
      }
</textarea></div>
<p>The provided code imports the OnInit hook, but implements the ngOnInit function. This demonstrates how other hooks can be imported and used within a component.</p>

<h3 class="h3">13) What is AOT in Angular?</h3>
<p>Angular utilizes AOT which stands for Ahead-Of-Time compiler to transform TypeScript and HTML code into optimized JavaScript code prior to it being downloaded and executed by a browser. This approach streamlines the rendering process by having the application compiled in the build phase, resulting in a faster loading time in the browser.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">14) What is the reason for using the AOT compiler in Angular?</h3>
<p>Angular applications consist of various components and HTML templates that cannot be directly understood by browsers. As a result, Angular applications require compilation prior to being launched in a browser. To achieve this, the use of Ahead of Time (AOT) compilers is necessary.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">15) What are the biggest advantages of AOT in Angular?</h3>
<p>The utilization of the AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compiler in Angular comes with several benefits, including:</p>
<p>By utilizing the AOT compiler, the execution time of rendering the application is significantly reduced. This is because the browser receives a pre-compiled version of the application to download, which includes executable code that can be immediately loaded and rendered without the need to compile it first. As a result, users can access the application more quickly.</p>
<p>The Angular framework has a smaller download size compared to others. This is due to the implementation of AOT, which allows for the omission of the Angular compiler if the app has already been compiled. The compiler makes up around half of Angular's size, so not needing it greatly reduces the overall payload of the application.</p>
<p>The use of a compiler can lead to a reduction in asynchronous requests required by an application. This is achieved by inlining external HTML templates and CSS stylesheets within the JavaScript code of the application, which removes the need for separate AJAX requests for these files.</p>
<p>By utilizing the AOT compiler, developers are able to identify template binding errors early on in the build process and report them before they can affect the user experience. This method helps to prevent users from encountering errors and ensures a smoother experience overall.</p>
<p>When it comes to security, AOT (Ahead-of-Time compilation) is a preferred option for web applications. This is because AOT compiles HTML templates and components into JavaScript files before sending them to the client, eliminating the need for client-side HTML or JavaScript evaluation. This, in turn, significantly minimizes the risk of injection attacks.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">16) What is JIT in Angular?</h3>
<p>Angular relies on a compiler called JIT or Just-in-Time compiler. Unlike traditional compilers, the JIT compiler provides dynamic translation or run-time compilation. This means that computer code is compiled during the execution of a program, rather than before it. As a result, JIT enables programs to execute faster and makes it easier to develop code on the fly.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">17) What is the main difference between JIT and AOT in Angular?</h3>
<p>These are the primary distinctions between the JIT and AOT compilers in Angular:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>One method of compiling an application in the browser is the Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler, which compiles the application code during runtime. An alternative approach is the Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler, which compiles the application code during the build process on the server.</li>
<li>The Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation feature is executed by default when using the ng build (build only) or ng serve (build and serve locally) CLI commands during development. However, for Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation, you need to specify the --aot option along with the ng build or ng serve command.</li>
<li>Angular projects can be compiled using either JIT or AOT methods. During development, JIT is employed, while production mode necessitates the use of AOT.</li>
<li>JIT is a convenient option due to its ease of use and simple debugging capabilities that come with a map file. However, AOT is ideal for production because it minimizes bundle size resulting in faster rendering.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">18) What is the concept of scope hierarchy in Angular?</h3>
<p>In Angular, a hierarchy of $scope objects is available for use in views. This hierarchy is called the scope hierarchy, consisting of a primary root scope and subsidiary child scopes. The root scope can contain multiple child scopes arranged hierarchically.</p>
<p>A scope hierarchy is a structure in which each view has its own unique $scope. Consequently, any variables defined by a specific view's view controller will not be visible to other view controllers.</p>
<p><strong>A typical structure for outlining a Scope Hierarchy is shown below:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">Root $scope
$scope for Controller 1
$scope for Controller 2
...
..
.
$scope for Controller n

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">20) What is the difference between Observables and Promises in Angular?</h3>
<p>When we create a promise in Angular, it starts executing immediately. However, observables in Angular are different as they are considered lazy. This means that nothing happens until someone subscribes to them.</p>
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Promise</th>
<th>Observable</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This means that it only produces one output.</td>
<td>It sends out several data points continuously over a given span.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not Lazy</td>
<td>The behavior of an observable is lazy, meaning that it waits to execute until we subscribe to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We can not cancel<br>
it.</td>
<td>To stop receiving unwanted messages or emails, we can use the unsubscribe() function provided by the service.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Observable is equipped with an assortment of operators such as filter, map, forEach, reduce, retry, and retryWhen, to name a few.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>To avoid plagiarism, we need to rephrase the original content in our own words. For instance, let's take a look at the following paragraph:

"Plagiarism is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. It involves using someone else's work or ideas without proper attribution. To avoid this, it's important to paraphrase the original content and give credit to the original source. By doing so, we can maintain academic integrity and respect the work of others." 

A possible rephrased version could be:

The act of plagiarism should not be taken lightly as it undermines academic honesty. Essentially, it pertains to taking someone else's ideas or work and presenting it as one's own, without acknowledging the source. To prevent plagiarism, one should paraphrase the content in their own words and cite the original source. Respecting the efforts of others is paramount in maintaining scholarly integrity.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">const observable = rxjs.Observable.create(observer =&gt; {
        console.log('This is what inside an observable');
        observer.next('Hello JavaTpoint');
        observer.complete();
      });
      console.log('Before subscribing an Observable');
      observable.subscribe((message)=&gt; console.log(message)); 
</textarea></div>
<p>After running the Observable mentioned above, you will be able to view a sequence of messages displayed in a specific order as follows:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">Before subscribing an Observable
This is what inside an observable
Hello JavaTpoint
</textarea></div>
<p>The code snippet shows that observables have a lazy behavior, meaning they execute only when someone subscribes to them. This is evident from the fact that the message "Before subscribing an Observable" is printed before the message within the observable.</p>
<p><strong>Here's an example of how a Promise can be used in JavaScript.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
        console.log('This is what written inside promise');
        resolve('Hello JavaTpoint');
      });
      console.log('Before calling then method on Promise');
      greetingPoster.then(message =&gt; console.log(message)); 
</textarea></div>
<p>If you execute the Promise code mentioned above, you will observe that the messages are outputted in the given sequence:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">This is what written inside Promise
Before calling then method on Promise
Hello JavaTpoint
</textarea></div>
<p>In the given code snippet, the message written inside the Promise statement is printed before the execution of the method. This indicates that the Promise is executed first, followed by the method.</p>
<p>One key difference between Promises and Observables is that Promises are inherently asynchronous, even when they're resolved immediately. In contrast, Observables can be either synchronous or asynchronous.</p>
<p>Sure, here's a rephrased version:

An observable is a key concept in reactive programming that represents a stream of data that can be consumed by an application. Observables can either be synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the nature of the data stream. For example, in a synchronous observable, data is emitted in real-time and consumed by the application as it's produced. However, with an asynchronous observable, data is emitted at irregular intervals or in response to events, which requires a different approach to consumption. Understanding these differences is important for any developer working with reactive programming.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">      const observable = rxjs.Observable.create(observer =&gt; {
        setTimeout(()=&gt;{
            observer.next('Hello JavaTpoint');
            observer.complete();
        },3000)
      });
      console.log('Before calling subscribe on an Observable');
      observable.subscribe((data)=&gt; console.log(data));
      console.log('After calling subscribe on an Observable'); 
</textarea></div>
<p>If you execute the above mentioned observable, you will observe that the messages will be displayed in a specific sequence:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">Before calling subscribe on an Observable
After calling subscribe on an Observable
Hello JavaTpoint

<h3 class="h3">22) What are directives in Angular?</h3>
<p>In Angular, a directive is defined as a class that utilizes a @Directive decorator. Each directive provides a unique functionality that can be imported into different components within an application.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">23) What were the main reasons behind introducing client-side frameworks like Angular? </h3>
<p>Angular was developed as a solution to the limitations faced by web developers who used VanillaJS and jQuery in building dynamic websites. The primary issue with these technologies was that as the complexity of the website grew, the code became challenging to maintain. This made it difficult for developers to maintain separation of concerns for the app, especially for websites and applications that use complex logic. Additionally, jQuery did not offer any facilities for data handling across views.</p>
<p>Angular was created to overcome the limitations of VanilaJS and jQuery. It introduces the concept of components, allowing developers to break down complex code into smaller, more manageable pieces. This provides a clear separation of concerns and improves overall code organization. Ultimately, this makes it easier to develop and maintain large-scale web applications.</p>
<p>Angular is a popular client-side framework used by developers to create advanced web applications like Single-Page-Applications. The purpose of introducing Angular was to facilitate the development of fast, scalable, and dynamic web applications with ease. Its popularity is due to its capability to deliver outstanding web application performance and provide developers with the necessary tools and components to build professional, high-quality applications.</p>
<h4 class="n">Note: We can also develop dynamic websites and SPAs (Single Page Applications) using VanillaJS, and jQuery but by doing so, the development process becomes slower.</h4>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">24) What is Angular CLI?</h3>
<p>The Angular CLI, which stands for Angular Command Line Interface, is a tool that uses node.js style modules to create and develop Angular applications through a command-line interface. It offers various features to simplify the development process and make it more efficient.</p>
<p>In order to utilize Angular CLI, it is necessary to first install it through the npm command.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">npm install @angular/cli@latest
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Here are some essential commands that can come in handy during the construction of an Angular project:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Creating New Project:</strong> ng new</li>
<li><strong>Creating Components, Directives and Services:</strong> ng generate/g</li>
<li><strong>Running the Project:</strong> ng serve</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">25) What is lazy loading in Angular? </h3>
<p>Angular Routing offers the concept of lazy loading which allows web pages to be downloaded in chunks instead of one big bundle. This feature is highly advantageous as it makes downloading web pages easier and more efficient. It works by asynchronously loading the feature module for routing whenever required using the property loadChildren.</p>
<p>Below is an example of how to implement lazy loading for multiple feature modules in an application. Specifically, we will be loading the Employee and Order modules lazily to improve performance and reduce load times.</p>
<p><strong>See the example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'employees',
    loadChildren: () =&gt; import('./employees/employees.module').then(module =&gt; module.EmployeesModule)
  },
  {
    path: 'orders',
    loadChildren: () =&gt; import('./orders/orders.module').then(module =&gt; module.OrdersModule)
  },
  {
    path: '',
    redirectTo: '',
    pathMatch: 'full'
  }
];

<h3 class="h3">26) What is Angular Router? </h3>
<p>The Angular Router is a tool that enables users to move from one view to another while performing tasks within an application. Its navigation model is based on the same concept as that of a web browser.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">27) What do you understand by the router imports?</h3>
<p>The Angular Router, which defines a specific component view for a given URL, is not a built-in part of Angular Core. Instead, it can be found in the @angular/router library, which must be imported to access the necessary router components. This is known as importing the router.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how we can bring external libraries into our app module:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">28) What do you understand by RouterOutlet and RouterLink? </h3>
<p>A RouterOutlet is a built-in directive provided by the router library, which serves as a marker where the Router will render the components for that outlet. It acts as a placeholder in the template that signifies the location where the Router should display the corresponding components. Essentially, Router outlet is a vital component used in routing.</p>
<p>Please provide me with the content that needs to be rephrased so I can provide a unique version.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;
</textarea></div>
<p>A router is a feature in Angular that provides the capability to perform navigation between views. It keeps track of the current URL and decides what should be displayed on the screen based on the routing configuration. When a user clicks on a link or enters a URL in the browser, the router intercepts the request and loads the corresponding component.

On the other hand, a RouterLink is a directive in Angular that can be applied to anchor tags to give the router control over them. By specifying fixed navigation paths as string values, the RouterLink directive enables users to navigate between views within the Angular app.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">&lt;h1&gt;Angular Router&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;nav&gt;
  &lt;a routerLink="/todosList" &gt;List of todos&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a routerLink="/completed" &gt;Completed todos&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">29) What are the different router events used in Angular Router?</h3>
<p>The Router in Angular emits navigation events for each route navigation through its Router.events property. This feature enables developers to monitor and track the lifecycle of a route operation and perform appropriate actions.</p>
<p><strong>The following list outlines the order of events for routers.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>NavigationStart</li>
<li>RouteConfigLoadStart</li>
<li>RouteConfigLoadEnd</li>
<li>RoutesRecognized</li>
<li>GuardsCheckStart</li>
<li>ChildActivationStart</li>
<li>ActivationStart</li>
<li>GuardsCheckEnd</li>
<li>ResolveStart</li>
<li>ResolveEnd</li>
<li>ActivationEnd</li>
<li>ChildActivationEnd</li>
<li>NavigationEnd</li>
<li>NavigationCancel</li>
<li>NavigationError</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">30) What do you understand by the RouterLinkActive?</h3>
<p>The RouterLinkActive directive is utilized to modify CSS classes for active RouterLink bindings according to the current RouterState. When a link is active, the Router will apply CSS classes, and when it is inactive, it will remove them.</p>
<p>One way to incorporate Angular material icons is by using them in RouterLinks. This can be done by adding them to RouterLinks in the code.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">&lt;h1&gt;Angular Router&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;nav&gt;
  &lt;a routerLink="/todosList" routerLinkActive="active"&gt;List of todos&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a routerLink="/completed" routerLinkActive="active"&gt;Completed todos&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">31) What do you understand by the RouterState?</h3>
<p>The RouterState represents a hierarchical structure of the activated routes in an application. Each node in this hierarchy is aware of the URL segments that have been processed, the parameters that have been extracted, and the data that has been resolved. The current RouterState can be retrieved using the Router service and its routerState property, which allows us to access this information from anywhere in our application.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">@Component({templateUrl:'template.html'})
class MyComponent {
  constructor(router: Router) {
    const state: RouterState = router.routerState;
    const root: ActivatedRoute = state.root;
    const child = root.firstChild;
    const id: Observable&lt;string&gt; = child.params.map(p =&gt; p.id);
    //...
  }
}
&lt;/string&gt;</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">32) What is HttpClient, and what are the advantages of it?</h3>
<p>Front-end applications typically use either XMLHttpRequest interface or the fetch() API to communicate with backend services via the HTTP protocol. Similarly, Angular provides a streamlined HTTP client API called HttpClient that simplifies the process of communicating with backend services. HttpClient is built on top of XMLHttpRequest interface and is available in the @angular/common/http package. To access HttpClient in your root module, you simply need to import the package.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>The benefits of using HttpClient are significant. This tool provides several advantages that make it an excellent choice for network communication.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The HttpClient library has capabilities that aid in enabling tests to be performed on the software.</li>
<li>The library offers objects for requests and responses that have been typed.</li>
<li>The tool is capable of capturing both the incoming requests and outgoing responses.</li>
<li>Observable APIs are compatible with this software.</li>
<li>HttpClient offers a convenient way to handle errors in an efficient manner.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">33) By default, Angular uses client-side rendering for its applications. Is it possible to make an Angular application to render on the server-side?</h3>
<p>Certainly! Angular offers a solution called Angular Universal that enables the rendering of applications on the server-side. This means it is possible to create an Angular application that can be rendered on the server.</p>
<p>Angular Universal offers several key benefits for web developers. These benefits include:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Implementing server-side rendering in an Angular application can significantly improve the user experience by enabling new users to view the application immediately. This approach can be especially useful in enhancing the UI and overall usability of the application.</li>
<li>Angular Universal can enhance the SEO of your application by making your content accessible to search engines. This is because search engines often look for HTML pages, and Angular Universal can ensure that your content is available to them in that format. By making your content more easily discoverable, you can improve your application's SEO.</li>
<li>Applications that are server-side rendered typically load faster than standard pages due to the quicker availability of the rendered pages to the browser.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">34) What is the best way to perform Error handling in Angular? </h3>
<p>When a request made by HttpClient fails to reach the server or fails on the server, it results in an error. In such situations, HttpClient doesn't return a successful response but instead returns an error object. To handle this scenario, we need to incorporate error-handling logic by passing the error object as an argument to the subscribe() method.</p>
<p><strong>Please refer to the following example to gain an understanding of how we manage situations within our component:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">fetchUser() {
  this.userService.getProfile()
    .subscribe(
      (data: User) =&gt; this.userProfile = { ...data }, // success path
      error =&gt; this.error = error // error path
    );
}
</textarea></div>
<p>Consider crafting a more informative error message for the user rather than displaying the original error object obtained from HttpClient.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">35) What do you understand by Angular bootstrapping? </h3>
<p>Angular bootstrapping is a process that enables developers to initialize and launch their Angular applications. Angular offers two forms of bootstrapping: ...</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Manual bootstrapping</li>
<li>Automatic bootstrapping</li>
</ul>
<p>Manual bootstrapping is a technique that grants developers greater control over when and how they initialize an Angular application. This allows them to carry out other activities or operations prior to the compilation of the page. Manual bootstrapping is particularly helpful for professionals seeking more flexibility in managing the Angular app.</p>
<p>Automatically bootstrapping an Angular app refers to the process of starting the application without any manual intervention. In order to enable automatic bootstrapping, developers must add the ng-app directive to the root of the application. Once Angular detects this directive, it will automatically load the associated module and compile the DOM, without requiring any further input from the developer.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">36) What is the digest cycle process in Angular? </h3>
<p>The Angular framework uses a process called digest cycle to keep track of changes in watch variables. This process continuously monitors the watchlist, comparing the current and previous versions of scope model values, and updating them accordingly.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">37) What are the key differences between a Component and a Directive in Angular? </h3>
<p>A Component is a directive that leverages the shadow DOM to establish isolated visual behavior. Its primary purpose is to break down applications into smaller, encapsulated parts, helping to create UI widgets. Essentially, a component (@component) represents a directive-with-a-template.</p>
<p><strong>The following are the main distinctions between a Component and a Directive in Angular:</strong></p>
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Component</th>
<th>Directive</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In software development, components are often utilized to build user interface elements.</td>
<td>Directives are typically utilized to augment the functionality of an already present DOM element.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>To register a component in Java, we make use of attributes found in the @Component meta-data annotation.</td>
<td>@Directive meta-data annotation attributes are leveraged for the purpose of registering directives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The purpose of componentization in an application is to divide it into smaller, more manageable pieces known as components.</td>
<td>Reusable component design is an important use case for this tool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It is necessary to use only one component for each DOM element.</td>
<td>It is possible to use more than one directive for a single DOM element.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It is required to either use the @View decorator or include a templateUrl/template in a component.</td>
<td>A Directive does not employ the use of View.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A pipe is formulated with the aid of a component.</td>
<td>A directive cannot include the definition of Pipes.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">38) What do you understand by Angular MVVM architecture? </h3>
<p>The MVVM architecture is a software design pattern that enables developers to separate the front-end development (View) from the back-end logic development (Model). This helps in making the View independent of any specific Model platform, thus providing flexibility to the developer.</p>
<p>The Angular MVVM design pattern is composed of three core components:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Model</li>
<li>View</li>
<li>ViewModel</li>
</ul>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/top-angular-interview-questions-q38.png" alt="Angular Interview questions">
<p>The model is a representation of an entity's structure and outlines the methodology used. Essentially, it comprises the data associated with an object.</p>
<p>The View is the part of an application that presents the user interface. It defines the layout, appearance, and structure of what the user sees on their screen. Its purpose is to display the information stored in the Model, and to interact with the user's actions, such as button clicks, screen taps, or keyboard inputs, and pass these on to the ViewModel through data binding. In Angular, the View corresponds to a component's HTML template.</p>
<p>The ViewModel serves as an intermediary between the view and model in an application. It provides the logic for the application and manages its data. With two-way data-binding, any updates made in the view are reflected in the ViewModel, which then modifies the associated data in the model.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">39) What is the purpose of AsyncPipe in Angular? </h3>
<p>The AsyncPipe is a mechanism for subscribing to an observable or promise and retrieving the most recent value it has produced. Whenever a new value is generated, the component that has been checked for changes is flagged by the pipe.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates how a time observable can be used to update the view every 2 seconds with the current time information.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">@Component({
  selector: 'async-observable-pipe',
  template: `&lt;div&gt;&lt;code&gt;observable|async&lt;/code&gt;:
       Time: {{ time | async }}&lt;/div&gt;`
})
export class AsyncObservablePipeComponent {
  time = new Observable(observer =&gt;
    setInterval(() =&gt; observer.next(new Date().toString()), 2000)
  );
}
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">40) What do you understand by services in Angular? </h3>
<p>In the Angular framework, services are objects that are instantiated as singletons throughout the entire application runtime. These services contain methods that help with managing and maintaining data throughout the lifespan of the application. They are an essential part of organizing and sharing business logic, data models, and functions among various application components. By utilizing Angular services, developers can more efficiently manage and maintain their application's data and logic.</p>
<p>Angular services provide a range of capabilities that can be accessed from an Angular component, like a directive or controller, through a set of functions.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">41) What is the key difference between a constructor and ngOnInit? </h3>
<p>In TypeScript classes, a constructor is a built-in method that is generally used for initialization purposes. Conversely, ngOnInit is an Angular method specifically designed for creating Angular bindings. While constructors run first, it is recommended to place all of your Angular bindings in the ngOnInit method.</p>
<p>Take this example where we use ngOnInit in our code by implementing the OnInit interface.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">export class App implements OnInit{
  constructor(){
     //called first time before the ngOnInit()

<h3 class="h3">42) What do you understand by observable and observer in Angular?</h3>
<p>An observable is a distinct entity that serves a similar purpose to promises in managing asynchronous code. However, observables are not native to JavaScript language and instead require the use of a library such as RxJS. Developers can create observables using the "new" keyword.</p>
<p>Here is an example that illustrates how observables can be used:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
const observable = new Observable(observer =&gt; {
  setTimeout(() =&gt; {
    observer.next('This is a message from Observable!');
  }, 1000);
}); 
</textarea></div>
<p>In the context of software design, an observer refers to an object that needs to be informed of any state changes in another object. When using the observer pattern, the observable object sends push-based notifications to the observer through an interface. This allows for efficient communication between objects and facilitates the coordination of their behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Can you provide me with the content that needs to be rephrased?</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">interface Observer&lt;T&gt; {
  closed?: boolean;
  next: (value: T) =&gt; void;
  error: (err: any) =&gt; void;
  complete: () =&gt; void;
} 
&lt;/T&gt;</textarea></div>
<p>To receive notifications from an observable, a handler that implements the observer interface needs to be provided as a parameter when creating the observable.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">myObservable.subscribe(myObserver);
</textarea></div>
<h4 class="n">Note: If you don't use a handler for a notification type, the observer ignores notifications of that type.</h4>

<h3 class="h3">43) How do you categorize data binding types in Angular? </h3>
<p>Angular has three different types of data binding based on the direction of data flow. These categories include:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>From the source-to-view</li>
<li>From view-to-source</li>
<li>View-to-source-to-view</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some suggestions for binding syntax that could possibly be used.</p>
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Data direction</th>
<th>Syntax</th>
<th>Type</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reworded: One-way data binding, where data flows only from the source to the view, is a common approach in programming.</td>
<td>1. {{expression}}<br>
2. [target]="expression"<br>
3. bind-target="expression"</td>
<td>Reword the following content in your own words:

"Interpolation, property, attribute, class, and style are all terms commonly used in web development."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rewritten: One-way data binding, also known as view-to-source, is a technique used to allow data to flow only in one direction, from the source to the view. It restricts updates to the source data when there is a change in the view.</td>
<td>1. (target)="statement"<br>
2. on-target="statement"</td>
<td>Event</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>View-to-source-to-view(Two-way data binding)</td>
<td>1. [(target)]="expression"<br>
2. bindon-target="expression"</td>
<td>Two-way data binding</td>
</tr>

<h3 class="h3">44) What is multicasting in Angular?</h3>
<p>Multicasting, also known as Multi-casting, is a technique used to send messages or data to multiple recipients at once. This method allows the broadcaster to reach a large audience with a single transmission.</p>
<p>Let me provide you with an instance to showcase the ability of multi-casting feature:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">var source = Rx.Observable.from([1, 2, 3]);
var subject = new Rx.Subject();
var multicasted = source.multicast(subject);
// These are, under the hood, `subject.subscribe({...})`:
multicasted.subscribe({
  next: (v) =&gt; console.log('observerA: ' + v)
});
multicasted.subscribe({
  next: (v) =&gt; console.log('observerB: ' + v)
});
</textarea></div>

<h3 class="h3">45) What do you understand by Angular Material?</h3>
<p>Angular Material is a comprehensive collection of UI components, highly sought after by web development experts, which enables them to create polished, visually appealing, and fully functional web interfaces and applications. This component library adopts modern design principles to ensure optimal website performance and accessibility, providing an array of useful features and creative possibilities for web design and development.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">46) What is lazy loading in Angular? Why is it used?</h3>
<p>When building Angular apps, we can use NgModules to organise our code. By default, NgModules are loaded eagerly, meaning they are all loaded when the app starts, even if they aren't immediately needed. However, for larger apps with many routes, it's better to use lazy loading. This means that NgModules are only loaded when they are required, rather than all at once. This approach reduces initial bundle sizes and helps to improve app load times.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">47) What is the use of Angular filters? What are its distinct types?</h3>
<p>Angular provides a crucial feature called 'filters', which enables us to format the expression value for display to users. Filters can be added seamlessly to services, directives, templates, or controllers and can also be customized to meet specific needs. They help organize data in a way that accurately matches predefined criteria, ensuring that only desired data is displayed. Filters are represented by the pipe symbol ( | ) while used in expressions.</p>
<p>Angular provides several kinds of filters for data processing. These filters perform various functions that aid in the manipulation and presentation of data in a user-friendly manner.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>currency:</strong> It is used to convert numbers to the currency format.</li>
<li><strong>filter:</strong> It is used to select a subset containing items from the given array.</li>
<li><strong>date:</strong> It is used to convert a date into a necessary format.</li>
<li><strong>lowercase:</strong> It is used to convert the given string into lowercase.</li>
<li><strong>uppercase:</strong> It is used to convert the given string into uppercase.</li>
<li><strong>orderBy: It</strong> is used to arrange an array by the given expression.</li>
<li><strong>json:</strong> It is used to format any object into a JSON string.</li>
<li><strong>number:</strong> It is used to convert a numeric value into a string.</li>
<li><strong>limitTo:</strong> It is used to restrict the limit of a given string or array to a particular number of elements or strings.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">48) When do we use a directive in Angular?</h3>
<p>In Angular applications, it can be difficult to implement the same functionality across multiple components. Instead of adding this functionality to each component independently, directives can be used. These directives contain the desired functionalities and can be imported to the relevant components. This makes it easier to manage and implement consistent functionalities throughout the application.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">49) What are the different types of directives in Angular?</h3>
<p>Angular has three primary types of directives that are commonly used.</p>
<p>Component Directives are an essential part of directives and are declared using the @Component decorator instead of @Directive. These directives contain a view, a selector property, and a stylesheet.</p>
<p>Structural directives are a type of Angular directive that allow manipulation of DOM elements. These directives are indicated by a symbol ' * ' and can be applied to any DOM element.</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few examples of structural directives that come pre-installed in a program or programming language:</strong></p>
<p>The *ngIf structural directive is utilized to examine the truthiness of a boolean value. If the condition is met, the div element will be rendered on the page.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">&lt;div *ngIf="isReady" class="display_name"&gt;
          {{name}}
      &lt;/div&gt;
</textarea></div>
<p>The *ngFor directive is a structural directive that allows developers to loop through a collection of data and display each item of the collection individually.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">      &lt;div class="details" *ngFor="let x of details" &gt;
          &lt;p&gt;{{x.name}}&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt; {{x.address}}&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;{{x.age}}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
</textarea></div>
<p>Here's a rephrased version: 

Attribute directives are commonly used in Angular to modify the presentation or behavior of specific DOM elements. These directives can be utilized in a variety of ways, including creating custom directives to suit your project's specific needs. To better understand attribute directives, we'll create one in this demonstration.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a way to make a unique directive:</strong></p>
<p>To generate a directive for an Angular app, one needs to access the command terminal and navigate to the app's directory. Then, the appropriate command can be typed to create the necessary directive.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">ng g directive yellowBackground 
</textarea></div>
<p>Please provide me with the original content so I can rephrase it without plagiarizing it.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">      import { Directive, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';
      @Directive({
       selector: '[appYellowBackground]'
      })
      export class YellowBackgroundDirective {
       constructor(el:ElementRef) {
         el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = "yellow";
       }
      }
</textarea></div>
<p>The instructions provided can be easily implemented to any element in the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">&lt;p appYellowBackground&gt;Hello JavaTpoint&lt;/p&gt;
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">50) What are string interpolation and property binding in Angular?</h3>
<p>Angular provides a feature known as data-binding that enables communication between the component and its view through the HTML template. The two main types of data-binding in Angular are one-way and two-way data binding. With one-way data binding, changes made in the component will automatically reflect in the HTML template, but not vice versa. Conversely, with two-way data binding, changes can be made in both the component and the HTML template, and they will be reflected in each other. Two examples of data-binding in Angular are string interpolation and property binding.</p>
<p>Both string interpolation and property binding are types of one-way data binding that enable data to flow in only one direction.</p>
<p>String interpolation is a feature used in Angular to display data from components. This is done using double curly braces {{ }} that automatically evaluates expressions enclosed within them. An example would be {{ 5+5 }}, which Angular will calculate and output the result, 10. This output is then displayed in the HTML template.</p>
<p>Property binding is a way to connect the properties of an HTML element to a component's property. This process uses the syntax of square brackets [ ].</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">51) Is it possible to make an angular application to render on the server-side?</h3>
<p>Certainly. It is possible to create an Angular application that can be rendered on the server-side. Angular has a feature called Angular Universal that enables developers to render applications on the server-side.</p>
<p><strong>Angular Universal provides several advantages that make it a popular choice.</strong></p>
<p>Improved User Experience: The feature allows for a quick and convenient display of the application interface, providing users with instant access to visual information.</p>
<p>Angular Universal can improve your website's search engine optimization by making sure that your content is accessible on all search engines, thereby improving your overall online visibility.</p>
<p>Angular Universal helps to speed up server-side application loading by quickly providing rendered pages to the browsers. This results in faster loading times for the pages.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">52) What is Dependency Injection in Angular?</h3>
<p>Angular makes use of a widely-used programming design pattern known as dependency injection. This pattern is crucial in defining the fundamental concepts in Angular and involves specific functionalities called services, which may be required by components and directives within an application. The process of injecting these dependencies into components and directives is streamlined by Angular's capabilities for seamless implementation.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">53) Can you demonstrate navigation between different routes in an Angular application?</h3>
<p>Here's an example of how to showcase route navigation in an Angular application called "My First App."</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">import from "@angular/router";
.
.
.
@Component({
  selector: 'app-header',
  template: `
&lt;nav class="navbar navbar-light bg-faded"&gt;
  &lt;a class="navbar-brand" (click)="goHome()"&gt;My First App&lt;/a&gt; 
  &lt;ul class="nav navbar-nav"&gt;
    &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
      &lt;a class="nav-link" (click)="goHome()"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt; 
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
      &lt;a class="nav-link" (click)="goSearch()"&gt;Search&lt;/a&gt; 
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
})
class HeaderComponent {
  constructor(private router: Router) {} 
  goHome() {
    this.router.navigate(['']); 
  }
  goSearch() {
    this.router.navigate(['search']); 
  }
}
