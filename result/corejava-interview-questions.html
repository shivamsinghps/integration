</div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">1) What is Java?</h3>
<p>Java is a programming language that is widely used due to its high-level properties, object-oriented nature, and secure programming methods. It's also known for being platform-independent, giving it the ability to function on different operating systems. Java was developed in June 1991 by professionals in the programming field. It's also considered to be a platform itself due to the resources it provides in the form of JRE and API.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">2) What are the differences between C++ and Java?</h3>
<p>The table provides a comparison between C++ and Java, outlining their differences.</p>
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr><th>Comparison Index</th> <th>C++</th><th>Java</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Platform-independent</strong></td><td>C++ is platform-dependent.</td><td>Java is platform-independent.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Mainly used for</strong></td><td>System programming is the primary application of the C++ language.</td><td>Java is a highly popular programming language that is commonly used for creating various types of applications. It is leveraged in the development of window-based, web-based, enterprise, and mobile applications.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Design Goal</strong></td><td>C++ was designed for systems and applications programming. It was an extension of <a href="c-programming-language-tutorial.html">C programming language</a>.</td><td>Java was designed and created as an interpreter for printing systems but later extended as a support network computing. It was designed with a goal of being easy to use and accessible to a broader audience.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Goto</strong></td><td>C++ supports the <a href="cpp-goto-statement.html">goto</a> statement.</td><td>Java does not provide support for the goto statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Multiple inheritance</strong></td><td>C++ allows for the usage of multiple inheritance, meaning that a class can inherit from multiple classes at the same time.</td><td>Java doesn't support multiple inheritance through class. It can be achieved by <a href="interface-in-java.html">interfaces in java</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Operator Overloading</strong></td><td>C++ supports <a href="cpp-overloading.html">operator overloading</a>.</td><td>In the Java programming language, it is not possible to perform operator overloading, which is a feature in some other programming languages that allows operators such as + or * to be defined to work with custom data types.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Pointers</strong></td><td>C++ supports <a href="cpp-pointers.html">pointers</a>. You can write pointer program in C++.</td><td>Although pointer support is available internally in Java, it is not possible to write pointer programs in Java. This means that Java has limitations when it comes to using pointers.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Compiler and Interpreter</strong></td><td>C++ uses compiler only. C++ is compiled and run using the compiler which converts source code into machine code so, C++ is platform dependent.
</td><td>Java is a programming language that employs both a compiler and interpreter. During the compilation process, Java source code is converted into bytecode. When the program is run, the bytecode is executed by an interpreter, resulting in the desired output. One of the benefits of Java's interpretation is that it allows the language to be platform-independent.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>The concept of Call by Value and Call by Reference is an important aspect of programming. It is essential to understand the difference between these two methods as they have different implications and outcomes in the execution of a program.</strong></td><td>In C++, function arguments can be passed using either call by value or call by reference.</td><td>The way Java handles passing parameters to methods is called call by value. This means that there is no support for call by reference in Java.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Structure and Union</strong></td><td>In C++, structures and unions are both supported as data types.</td><td>Unlike some other programming languages, such as C, Java does not provide support for structures and unions.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Thread Support</strong></td><td>The C++ language does not have inherent support for threads. Instead, the implementation of thread support in C++ relies on external libraries and frameworks.</td><td>Java has built-in <a href="multithreading-in-java.html">thread</a> support.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Documentation comment</strong></td><td>Documentation comments are not supported by the C++ programming language.</td><td>One of the features of Java is its ability to create documentation comments (/** ... */) in order to provide documentation for Java source code.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Virtual Keyword</strong></td><td>In C++, the virtual keyword is available to give flexibility in deciding whether a function should be overridden or not.</td><td>The Java programming language does not include the virtual keyword. This means that non-static methods are overridden by default, as they are considered to be virtual. Therefore, all non-static methods have the ability to be overridden.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>unsigned right shift &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></td><td>C++ doesn't support &gt;&gt;&gt; operator.</td><td>Java supports unsigned right shift &gt;&gt;&gt; operator that fills zero at the top for the negative numbers. For positive numbers, it works same like &gt;&gt; operator.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Inheritance Tree</strong></td><td>C++ generates a fresh hierarchy of inheritance every time it is implemented.</td><td>Java uses a single inheritance tree always because all classes are the child of Object class in java. The object class is the root of the <a href="inheritance-in-java.html">inheritance</a> tree in java.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Hardware</strong></td><td>C++ is a programming language that is designed to be more closely related to the underlying hardware.</td><td>Java has limited interaction with hardware and is not very hardware-dependent compared to other programming languages.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Object-oriented</strong></td><td>C++ is a programming language that follows the principles of object-oriented programming. In contrast, the C language lacks the ability to create a hierarchical structure with a single root.</td><td>Java is also an <a href="java-oops-concepts.html">object-oriented</a> language. However, everything (except fundamental types) is an object in Java. It is a single root hierarchy as everything gets derived from java.lang.Object.
</td></tr>

<h3 class="h3">3) List the features of Java Programming language.</h3>
<p>The Java Programming Language has various characteristics, which include:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Simple:</strong> Java is easy to learn. The syntax of Java is based on C++ which makes easier to write the program in it. </li><br>
<li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java follows the object-oriented paradigm which allows us to maintain our code as the combination of different type of objects that incorporates both data and behavior.</li><br>
<li><strong>Portable:</strong> Java supports read-once-write-anywhere approach. We can execute the Java program on every machine. Java program (.java) is converted to bytecode (.class) which can be easily run on every machine.</li><br>
<li><strong>Platform Independent:</strong> Java is a platform independent programming language. It is different from other programming languages like C and C++ which needs a platform to be executed. Java comes with its platform on which its code is executed. Java doesn't depend upon the operating system to be executed. </li><br>
<li><strong>Secured:</strong> Java is secured because it doesn't use explicit pointers. Java also provides the concept of ByteCode and Exception handling which makes it more secured.</li><br>
<li><strong>Robust:</strong> Java is a strong programming language as it uses strong memory management. The concepts like Automatic garbage collection, Exception handling, etc. make it more robust. </li><br>
<li><strong>Architecture Neutral:</strong> Java is architectural neutral as it is not dependent on the architecture. In C, the size of data types may vary according to the architecture (32 bit or 64 bit) which doesn't exist in Java.</li><br>
<li><strong>Interpreted:</strong> Java uses the Just-in-time (JIT) interpreter along with the compiler for the program execution.</li><br>
<li><strong>High Performance:</strong> Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because Java bytecode is "close" to native code. It is still a little bit slower than a compiled language (e.g., C++).</li><br>
<li><strong>Multithreaded:</strong> We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads are important for multi-media, Web applications, etc.</li><br>
<li><strong>Distributed:</strong> Java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed applications in Java. RMI and EJB are used for creating distributed applications. This feature of Java makes us able to access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet.</li><br>
<li><strong>Dynamic:</strong> Java is a dynamic language. It supports dynamic loading of classes. It means classes are loaded on demand. It also supports functions from its native languages, i.e., C and C++.</li><br>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">4) What do you understand by Java virtual machine?</h3>
<p>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a crucial element of the Java programming language. It provides a virtual environment that allows the computer to execute Java programs. The JVM serves as a run-time engine that initiates the Java application by calling the main method in the code. It is a specific implementation that must be present in the computer system to execute Java applications. In the process, the JVM compiles the Java code into bytecode, which is machine-independent and similar to the native code.</p>

</script>
<h3 class="h3">5) What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?</h3>
<h3 class="h4">JVM</h3>
<p>JVM is an acronym for Java Virtual Machine; it is an abstract machine which provides the runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It is a specification which specifies the working of Java Virtual Machine. Its implementation has been provided by Oracle and other companies. Its implementation is known as JRE.
</p>
<p>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a software that provides a runtime environment for executing Java programs. It is not tied to any specific hardware or software platform, making it platform-dependent. When a Java class is executed, a runtime instance of the JVM is created. The JVM has three distinct aspects: specification, implementation, and instance.</p>
<h3 class="h4">JRE</h3>
<p>JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It is the implementation of JVM. The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.
</p>
<h3 class="h4">JDK</h3>
<p>The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment that is used for the creation of Java applications and applets. It is a tangible tool that includes both the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and various development tools. The JDK is essentially a way to implement a specific Java Platform that has been released by the Oracle Corporation.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The Java Platform, Standard Edition is a widely-used platform for developing and running Java applications. It is a base layer that provides core functionalities such as libraries, utilities, and APIs.</li>
<li>The Java Platform, Enterprise Edition is a technology that enables the development and deployment of enterprise-level applications. It is designed to provide businesses with a flexible and scalable platform to build and manage their applications.</li>
<li>The Micro Edition Java Platform refers to a stripped-down version of the Java Platform that is designed for use in small devices with limited resources, such as mobile phones and embedded systems.</li>
</ul>
<a href="difference-between-jdk-jre-and-jvm.html">More Details.</a>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">6) How many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM?</h3>
<p>Many types:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Class(Method) Area:</strong> Class Area stores per-class structures such as the runtime constant pool, field, method data, and the code for methods.</li>
<li><strong>Heap:</strong> It is the runtime data area in which the memory is allocated to the objects</li>
<li><strong>Stack:</strong> Java Stack stores frames. It holds local variables and partial results, and plays a part in method invocation and return. Each thread has a private JVM stack, created at the same time as the thread. A new frame is created each time a method is invoked. A frame is destroyed when its method invocation completes.</li>
<li><strong>Program Counter Register:</strong> PC (program counter) register contains the address of the Java virtual machine instruction currently being executed.</li>
<li><strong>Native Method Stack:</strong> It contains all the native methods used in the application.</li>
</ol>
<a href="internal-details-of-jvm.html">More Details.</a>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">7) What is JIT compiler?</h3>
<p> Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler:  It is used to improve the performance. JIT compiles parts of the bytecode that have similar functionality at the same time, and hence reduces the amount of time needed for compilation. Here the term “compiler” refers to a translator from the instruction set of a Java virtual machine (JVM) to the instruction set of a specific CPU.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">8) What is the platform?</h3>
<p>A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a piece of software is executed. There are two types of platforms, software-based and hardware-based. Java provides the software-based platform.
</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">9) What are the main differences between the Java platform and other platforms?</h3>
<p>The Java platform has several distinguishing features that set it apart from other platforms.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Java is classified as a software-based platform, whereas there are other platforms available that may either be based on hardware or software.</li>
<li>Java is a programming language that functions on top of other hardware platforms. In contrast, other hardware components lack the ability to run Java programming.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">10) What gives Java its 'write once and run anywhere' nature? </h3>
<p>When a Java program is compiled, it is converted into a class file, which contains bytecode. This bytecode is an intermediary language that can be executed on any machine, regardless of the platform. It is not specific to any operating system or hardware configuration.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">11) What is classloader?</h3>
<p>The classloader is an essential part of the Java Virtual Machine that loads class files. It is responsible for loading a Java program when it is executed. Java has three default classloaders that perform this task.</p>
<ol class="points">
<li><strong>Bootstrap ClassLoader</strong>: This is the first classloader which is the superclass of Extension classloader. It loads the <em>rt.jar</em> file which contains all class files of Java Standard Edition like java.lang package classes, java.net package classes, java.util package classes, java.io package classes, java.sql package classes, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Extension ClassLoader</strong>: This is the child classloader of Bootstrap and parent classloader of System classloader. It loads the jar files located inside <em>$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext</em> directory.</li>
<li><strong>System/Application ClassLoader</strong>: This is the child classloader of Extension classloader. It loads the class files from the classpath. By default, the classpath is set to the current directory. You can change the classpath using "-cp" or "-classpath" switch. It is also known as Application classloader.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">12) Is Empty .java file name a valid source file name?</h3>
<p>Certainly! Here's a rephrased version of the content:

It is possible to save Java files with the file extension .java. After saving, we need to compile the file using the command "javac .java" and then run it using "java classname". For instance, a simple Java program can be saved and executed using this process.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">//save by .java only
class A{
public static void main(String args[]){
System.out.println("Hello java");
}
}
//compile by javac .java
//run by     java A
</textarea></div>
<p>To avoid plagiarism and maintain academic integrity, it is important to use your own words when writing. Simply copying and pasting information from another source can result in consequences such as a failing grade or even expulsion. Instead, try to understand the information and then rephrase it in a way that reflects your own understanding and voice. When quoting directly from a source, always use quotation marks and properly cite the original author to give them credit for their work.</p>
<p>"Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work and passing it off as your own. It is unethical and can have serious consequences. Always make sure to properly cite any sources you use in your work to avoid plagiarism." 

Rewritten: Using someone else's work and presenting it as your own is known as plagiarism. This kind of behavior is considered unethical and can result in severe penalties. It is essential to credit any sources you reference to prevent plagiarism in your work.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">13) Is delete, next, main, exit or null keyword in java?</h3>
<p>No.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">14) If I don't provide any arguments on the command line, then what will the value stored in the String array passed into the main() method, empty or NULL?</h3>
<p>The content states that a certain object or variable does not contain any value, but it is not considered null.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">15) What if I write static public void instead of public static void?</h3>
<p>Java code is not affected by the order of specifiers used in the program. Therefore, even if the order of specifiers is different from the usual convention, the code will still compile and run correctly.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">16) What is the default value of the local variables? </h3>
<p>The variables that are declared locally within a method or block do not have any default initial value assigned to them, whether they are of primitive types or object references.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">17) What are the various access specifiers in Java?</h3>
<p>Java's access specifiers are essential for defining the scope of a variable, method, or class in terms of accessibility. Access specifiers in Java comprise four keywords that determine this scope.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Public</strong> The classes, methods, or variables which are defined as public, can be accessed by any class or method.</li>
<li><strong>Protected</strong> Protected can be accessed by the class of the same package, or by the sub-class of this class, or within the same class.</li>
<li><strong>Default</strong> Default are accessible within the package only. By default, all the classes, methods, and variables are of default scope.</li>
<li><strong>Private</strong> The private class, methods, or variables defined as private can be accessed within the class only.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">18) What is the purpose of static methods and variables?</h3>
<p>Static methods or variables belong to the class rather than an individual object, meaning they are shared among all objects of that class. As a result, they are stored in the class area and do not require an object to be accessed. Static is useful for defining variables and methods that are universal to all objects of the class.</p>
<p>To illustrate, when modelling the gathering of students within a particular college, the name of the college would be an attribute common to all students. Consequently, the college name would typically be designated as a static attribute.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">19) What are the advantages of Packages in Java?</h3>
<p>Defining packages in Java has several benefits.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Packages help to prevent conflicts where two or more modules might have the same name by providing a way of organizing and grouping related modules together, thus avoiding naming collisions.</li>
<li>The Package offers simplified means of managing access control.</li>
<li>It is possible to define hidden classes within a package that are not visible to those outside of it. These classes can be used exclusively within the confines of the package.</li>
<li>Finding the relevant classes becomes less complex.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">20) What is the output of the following Java program?</h3>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class Test 
{
	public static void main (String args[]) 
	{
		System.out.println(10 + 20 + "Javatpoint"); 
		System.out.println("Javatpoint" + 10 + 20);
	}
}
</textarea></div>

</pre></div>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<p>In this scenario, the values 10 and 20 are regarded as numerical values and added together to produce the result 30. After that, the resulting value of 30 is treated as a string and combined with the string "Javatpoint." Thus, the output of the operation is "30Javatpoint."</p>
<p>The content describes two examples of string concatenation. In the first example, the strings "Hello" and "World" are concatenated into the string "Hello World". In the second example, the string "Javatpoint" is concatenated with the number 10 to form "Javatpoint10", which is then concatenated with the number 20 to form "Javatpoint1020".</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre>200Javatpoint
Javatpoint200
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<p>Here's a rephrased version of the content:

In the given scenario, the two numbers 10 and 20 will be multiplied before being treated as a string and then concatenated with the string "Javatpoint". The resulting output will therefore be "200Javatpoint".</p>
<p>Sure, here's my attempt:

In the first scenario, the numbers 10 and 20 will be added together to produce the result 30, since addition has a lower precedence than multiplication. This result will then be treated as a string and combined with the string "Javatpoint" to form the output "Javatpoint30".

In the second scenario, the numbers 10 and 20 will be multiplied first to produce the result 200, as multiplication has a higher precedence than addition. This result will then be treated as a string and concatenated with the string "Javatpoint" to create the output "Javatpoint200".</p>

<h2 class="h2">Core Java - OOPs Concepts: Initial OOPs Interview Questions</h2>
</div>
<p>The following is a compilation of over 50 interview questions related to OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and systems. These questions are divided into different categories for clarity, such as constructor questions, static questions, inheritance questions, abstraction questions, and polymorphism questions.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">23) What is object-oriented paradigm?</h3>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular programming paradigm that revolves around creating objects, which possess both data and methods specific to the class they belong to. The primary aim of the OOP paradigm is to improve modularity and reusability in software development. Objects, which are instances of classes, interact with one another to create efficient applications and programs. The OOP paradigm offers several features that make it highly useful in modern software development.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The program design strategy of following a bottom-up approach means starting with the smaller components and building up to create the larger program.</li>
<li>Data manipulation techniques that are used to modify an object's data are the primary focus in this context.</li>
<li>One of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming is encapsulation and abstraction, which allow for hiding intricate details from the user and presenting only the necessary functionality.</li>
<li>Real-time approach refers to a technique that involves the implementation of concepts like inheritance, abstraction, and more in real-time systems.</li>
<li>Several programming languages are built on the principles of the object-oriented paradigm. Included in these programming languages are C++, Simula, Smalltalk, Python, and C#.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">24) What is an object?</h3>
<p>An Object is an entity that exists in real-time and has its own state and behavior. In Java, an Object is an instance of a class that has instance variables representing the object's state and methods representing its behavior. An Object can be instantiated in Java by using the keyword "new" to create an instance of a class.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">25) What is the difference between an object-oriented programming language and object-based programming language?</h3>
<p>Object-oriented language and object-based language have fundamental distinctions between them.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Object-oriented languages adhere to all the principles of OOPs, but in contrast, the object-based language does not apply all the concepts of OOPs such as polymorphism and inheritance.</li>
<li>Object-oriented languages do not come with pre-built objects, whereas object-based languages do. For instance, JavaScript includes the window object.</li>
<li>Object-oriented programming is an approach where data and behavior are combined into individual objects. Java, C# and Smalltalk are some examples of object-oriented programming languages. On the other hand, object-based languages are those that follow a similar concept but do not support some features of object-oriented programming. JavaScript and VBScript are a few examples of object-based languages.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">26) What will be the initial value of an object reference which is defined as an instance variable? </h3>
<p>In Java, all object references start out with a null value.</p>
<hr>
<div class="q">
<h2 class="h2">Core Java - OOPs Concepts: Constructor Interview Questions</h2>
</div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">27) What is the constructor?</h3>
<p>A constructor is a specific type of method that serves the purpose of initializing an object's state. When a class is instantiated, memory is allocated for the object and the constructor is invoked. The default constructor of the class is called every time a new object is created using the "new" keyword. It is mandatory to name the constructor after the class and it should not have an explicit return type.</p>
<a href="java-constructor.html">More Details.</a>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">28) How many types of constructors are used in Java?</h3>
<p>In Java, constructors are classified into two types based on the parameters that are specified while invoking them.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Default Constructor:</strong> default constructor is the one which does not accept any value. The default constructor is mainly used to initialize the instance variable with the default values. It can also be used for performing some useful task on object creation. A default constructor is invoked implicitly by the compiler if there is no constructor defined in the class.</li>
<li><strong>Parameterized Constructor:</strong> The parameterized constructor is the one which can initialize the instance variables with the given values. In other words, we can say that the constructors which can accept the arguments are called parameterized constructors.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/Assets/images/core/java-constructor.png" alt="Java Constructors">
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">29) What is the purpose of a default constructor?</h3>
<p>The default constructor is responsible for initializing objects with default values. In Java, the default constructor is automatically generated by the compiler when there is no explicit constructor defined in the class.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class Student3{
int id;
String name;

void display(){System.out.println(id+" "+name);}

public static void main(String args[]){
Student3 s1=new Student3();
Student3 s2=new Student3();
s1.display();
s2.display();
}
}

<p>Output:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>0 null
0 null
</pre></div>
<p>The given code defines a class with a default constructor that initializes variables with default values, which are 0 and null.</p>
<img src="/Assets/images/default-constructor1.png" alt="Java default constructor"><br>
<a href="java-constructor.html"> More Details.</a>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">30) Does constructor return any value?</h3>
<p>Sure, here's a rephrased version of the answer:

It is true that constructors in a class implicitly return the current instance of the class. This means that there is no need to use an explicit return type with the constructor.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">31)Is constructor inherited?</h3>
<p>The statement refers to the fact that constructors are not passed down through inheritance. In other words, a constructor defined in a parent class cannot be inherited by a child class.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">32) Can you make a constructor final?</h3>
<p>Yes, it is not possible to declare the constructor as final.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">33) Can we overload the constructors?</h3>
<p>Certainly! Constructors in a class can be overloaded using two methods: changing the number of arguments taken by the constructor, or modifying the data type of the parameters used in the constructor. Here's an instance below.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class Test 
{
	int i; 
	public Test(int k)
	{
	    i=k;
	}
	public Test(int k, int m)
	{
	    System.out.println("Hi I am assigning the value max(k, m) to i");
	    if(k&gt;m)
	    {
	        i=k; 
	    }
	    else 
	    {
	        i=m;
	    }
	}
}
public class Main 
{
	public static void main (String args[]) 
	{
		Test test1 = new Test(10);
		Test test2 = new Test(12, 15);
		System.out.println(test1.i);
		System.out.println(test2.i);
	}
}
	</textarea></div>
<p>The program demonstrates constructor overloading in the class Test. It has two constructors - one with one argument and the other with two arguments. The first constructor initializes the variable i with the value 10 while the second constructor initializes i with the value 15.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">34) What do you understand by copy constructor in Java?</h3>
<p>Java does not have a copy constructor like C++. But we can achieve the same result by copying the values from one object to another.</p>
<p>There exist numerous techniques to replicate the values of an object in Java into a different object.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>By constructor</li>
<li>One way to copy values from one object to another is by assigning those values directly.</li>
<li>One way to create a copy of an object in Java is to use the clone() method that is provided by the Object class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of how to use a Java constructor to transfer the values of one object to another. The method involves creating a new object and initializing it with the values of an existing object. This is a common technique when working with multiple objects in Java programming.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">//Java program to initialize the values from one object to another
class Student6{
    int id;
    String name;
    //constructor to initialize integer and string
    Student6(int i,String n){
    id = i;
    name = n;
    }
    //constructor to initialize another object
    Student6(Student6 s){
    id = s.id;
    name =s.name;
    }
    void display(){System.out.println(id+" "+name);}
 
    public static void main(String args[]){
    Student6 s1 = new Student6(111,"Karan");
    Student6 s2 = new Student6(s1);
    s1.display();
    s2.display();
   }
}
</textarea></div>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">35) What are the differences between the constructors and methods?</h3>
<p>Constructors and methods have distinct characteristics that set them apart. Let's take a closer look at their differences.</p>
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr><th>Java Constructor</th><th>Java Method</th></tr>
<tr><td>A constructor is responsible for setting the initial values of an object's state variables.</td><td>One way to reveal how an object works is by utilizing a technique that uncovers its behavior.</td></tr>
<tr><td>To avoid plagiarism, the sentence can be rephrased as follows - The return type is not allowed in the constructor.</td><td>Every method in programming needs to have a specified return type.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The constructor is called without being explicitly invoked.</td><td>You could reword it as: The process is called upon directly by a user or application, rather than automatically initiated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>If a class in Java has no constructor, the Java compiler will automatically create a default constructor for it.</td><td>The compiler does not offer the method under any circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The name given to the method that constructs or initializes an object must be identical to the name of the class.</td><td>It is possible for the name of a method to be different from the name of the class it belongs to.</td></tr>

<h3 class="h3">36) What is the output of the following Java program?</h3>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">public class Test 
{
    Test(int a, int b)
    {
        System.out.println("a = "+a+" b = "+b);
    }
    Test(int a, float b)
    {
        System.out.println("a = "+a+" b = "+b);
    }
    public static void main (String args[])
    {

        byte b = 15;
        Test test = new Test(a,b);
    }
}
</textarea></div>
<p>I'm sorry, but what content are you referring to? Can you please provide more information or context?</p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>a = 10 b = 15
</pre></div>
<p>In this scenario, the variables a and b are of the byte data type and are promoted to int when invoking the first parameterized constructor with two integer parameters.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">37) What is the output of the following Java program? </h3>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class Test

	{
		Test test = new Test(); 
		System.out.println(test.i);
	}
}
</textarea></div>
<p>The program produces an output of 0 as the variable i is initialized to 0 internally. Since there is no constructor present in the class, a default constructor is invoked implicitly, which initializes the variable i to 0.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">38) What is the output of the following Java program?</h3>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class Test

	public static void main (String args[]) 
	{
		Test test = new Test(); 
		System.out.println(test.test_a+" "+test.test_b);
	}
}
</textarea></div>
<p>The program has a compiler error due to an attempt to call the default constructor in the main method, but there is no such constructor in the Test class. Only a parameterized constructor is present in the class, which means that no default constructor is invoked implicitly by the constructor.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Core Java - OOPs Concepts: static keyword Interview Questions</h2>
</div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">39) What is the static variable?</h3>
<p>
The static variable is used to refer to the common property of all objects (that is not unique for each object), e.g., The company name of employees, college name of students, etc. Static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading. Using a static variable makes your program more memory efficient (it saves memory). Static variable belongs to the class rather than the object.

<h3 class="h3">40) What is the static method?</h3>
<ul>
<li>A static method is a method that is associated with a class and not with an instance of the class. It is a method that belongs to the class itself rather than to any specific object created from the class.</li>
<li>It is not necessary to instantiate an object in order to invoke static methods.</li>
<li>A static method has the ability to both access and alter the value of a static variable.</li>
</ul>
<a href="static-keyword-in-java.html">More Details.</a>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">41) What are the restrictions that are applied to the Java static methods?</h3>
<p>Static methods have limitations imposed on them in terms of their functionality. These limitations are primarily categorised into two types.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>A static method is unable to utilize data members that are not static or directly invoke non-static methods.</li>
<li>The statement refers to the fact that the non-static methods "this" and "super" cannot be used in a static context. This means that if a method is declared as static, it cannot access non-static methods or variables, including those of its own class.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">42) Why is the main method static?</h3>
<p> Because the object is not required to call the static method. If we make the main method non-static, JVM will have to create its object first and then call main() method which will lead to the extra memory allocation.  More Details. 
</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">43) Can we override the static methods?</h3>
<p>No, we can't override static methods.
</p><h3 class="h3">44) What is the static block?</h3>
<p>A static block is a code block that is used to initialize the static data member of a class. It is executed during the class loading process, before the main method is called.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class A2{
  static{System.out.println("static block is invoked");}
  public static void main(String args[]){
   System.out.println("Hello main");

<h3 class="h3">45) Can we execute a program without main() method?</h3>
<p> Ans) No, It was possible before JDK 1.7 using the static block. Since JDK 1.7, it is not possible.   More Details. 
</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">46) What if the static modifier is removed from the signature of the main method?</h3>
<p>The code successfully passes through the compilation phase but generates a runtime error known as "NoSuchMethodError."</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">47) What is the difference between static (class) method and instance method?</h3>
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr><th>static or class method</th><th>instance method</th></tr>
<tr><td>A static method refers to a type of method that has been declared as static.</td><td>An instance method is a type of method that is not categorized as static.</td></tr>
<tr><td>One can call static methods without creating objects.</td><td>The instance methods can only be invoked by using the object.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Static context, which includes static methods, static blocks, and static nested classes, cannot directly access non-static or instance members. This means that non-static members must be accessed through an instance of the class.</td><td>Both static and non-static variables can be accessed in methods that are specific to an instance of a class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Here's an original version of the code example:

```
public static int calculateCube(int number) {
    return number * number * number;
}
```

This code defines a method called `calculateCube` that takes an integer `number` as its input and returns the result of cubing that number. The `return` statement uses the `*` operator to multiply the number by itself three times, effectively computing its cube. This method is declared as `public static` so that it can be accessed from anywhere in the same Java program without needing an instance of the class that defines it.</td><td>An example of a method declaration in Java is shown with the syntax "public void msg() { ... }".</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">48) Can we make constructors static?</h3>
<p>Constructors are a crucial part of object creation in Java. Unlike the instance methods of a class, constructors belong specifically to the object being created, rather than the class itself. For this reason, it would not make sense to make a constructor static. In fact, if you were to try and create a static constructor, the compiler would throw an error.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">49) Can we make the abstract methods static in Java?</h3>
<p>When writing in Java, if we define abstract methods as static, they become an integral part of the class and can be called directly. However, doing this is pointless as calling a method that isn't defined isn't useful, hence this is not permitted.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">50) Can we declare the static variables and methods in an abstract class?</h3>
<p>It is possible to create static variables and methods within an abstract class. Since no object is needed to access the static context, it can be accessed using the name of the abstract class. For instance, you can use the following example to illustrate this.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">abstract class Test
{
    static int i = 102;
    static void TestMethod()
    {
        System.out.println("hi !! I am good !!");
    }
}
public class TestClass extends Test 
{
    public static void main (String args[])
    {
        Test.TestMethod();
        System.out.println("i = "+Test.i);
    }
}

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">51) What is <strong>this</strong> keyword in java?</h3>
<p>The "this" keyword in Java refers to the current object. It acts as a reference variable and can be used to refer to properties of the current class, including instance methods, variables, constructors, etc. Additionally, it can be passed as an argument to methods or constructors and returned from a method as the current class instance.</p>
<img src="/Assets/images/thisr.jpg" alt="java this keyword"><br>
<a href="this-keyword.html"> More Details.</a>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">52) What are the main uses of this keyword?</h3>
<p>The term "this" has multiple functions and purposes in various contexts.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>this</strong> can be used to refer to the current class instance variable.</li>
<li><strong>this</strong> can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)</li>
<li><strong>this()</strong> can be used to invoke the current class constructor.</li>
<li><strong>this</strong> can be passed as an argument in the method call.</li>
<li><strong>this</strong> can be passed as an argument in the constructor call.</li>
<li><strong>this</strong> can be used to return the current class instance from the method.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">53) Can we assign the reference to <strong>this</strong> variable?</h3>
<p>It's not possible to assign 'this' to a value in Java because it's a final reference that always refers to the current class object. Trying to assign it to a value would result in a compiler error.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">public class Test
{
    public Test()
    {
        this = null; 
        System.out.println("Test class constructor called");
    }
    public static void main (String args[])
    {
        Test t = new Test();
    }
}
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>Test.java:5: error: cannot assign a value to final variable this
        this = null; 
        ^
1 error
</pre></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">54) Can <strong>this</strong> keyword be used to refer static members?</h3>
<p>Certainly. Using the "this" keyword to refer to static members is technically possible since it is a reference variable to the current class object. However, it's not recommended nor necessary as static variables can be accessed without creating an object instance. It is considered best practice to avoid using "this" for static members. Here's an example to demonstrate.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">public class Test 
{
    static int i = 10; 
    public Test ()
    {
        System.out.println(this.i);

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">55) How can constructor chaining be done using this keyword?</h3>
<p>Constructor chaining is a feature that allows us to call one constructor from another constructor of the same class using the current class object. To achieve this, we can use the 'this' keyword. It is useful to simplify the code and reduce redundancy. The concept can be demonstrated through an example.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">public class Employee
{
    int id,age; 
    String name, address;
    public Employee (int age)
    {
        this.age = age;
    }
    public Employee(int id, int age)
    {
        this(age);
        this.id = id;
    }
    public Employee(int id, int age, String name, String address)
    {

<h3 class="h3">56) What are the advantages of passing this into a method instead of the current class object itself?</h3>
<p>When passing `this` into a method, it refers to the current class object. As a result, it must have similar properties and characteristics to the current class object. The benefits of using `this` within a method are that it can simplify the code by reducing the number of variables passed as arguments, and it allows the method to access all of the class's public and private properties.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The difference between a final variable and a class object is that the former cannot be assigned a new value once it has been declared, while the latter may potentially be modified. Final variables are constant, while class objects may change over time.</li>
<li>One possible alternative wording could be: The synchronized block is a construct in Java that can be utilized for thread safety when working with shared resources. It provides a way to ensure that only one thread at a time can access the critical section of code enclosed within the synchronized block.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">57) What is the Inheritance?</h3>
<p>Inheritance is a mechanism by which one object acquires all the properties and behavior of another object of another class. It is used for Code Reusability and Method Overriding. The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also. Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.
</p>
<p>In Java, there exist five distinct forms of inheritance.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Single-level inheritance</li>
<li>Multi-level inheritance</li>
<li>Multiple Inheritance</li>
<li>Hierarchical Inheritance</li>
<li>Hybrid Inheritance</li>
</ul>
<p>Java does not provide support for multiple inheritance using classes.</p>
<a href="inheritance-in-java.html">More Details.</a>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">58) Why is Inheritance used in Java? </h3>
<p>In Java programming, using inheritance offers multiple benefits that include:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>One of the benefits of inheritance is that it allows for the reuse of code. When a new class is derived from an existing class, it can use all the methods and attributes of the base class without having to redefine them. The derived class can choose to implement its own version of a method if needed, but it does not have to repeat code that has already been written in the base class.</li>
<li>In order to achieve runtime polymorphism, inheritance is necessary.</li>
<li>It is possible to create a real-time simulation of class inheritance which adds a more realistic element to Object-Oriented Programming.</li>
<li>Inheritance offers a way of concealing data. This is accomplished by making certain data private in the base class, which prevents it from being accessible to the derived class.</li>
<li>The concept of method overriding relies on inheritance, as it allows for the modification of an existing method in a base class with a specific implementation in a subclass. In essence, it allows for the customization of pre-existing methods.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">59) Which class is the superclass for all the classes? </h3>
<p>In Java, all classes inherit from the object class, which serves as the root superclass of all classes in the language.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">60) Why is multiple inheritance not supported in java?</h3>
<p>Java does not allow multiple inheritance to reduce complexity and simplify the language. This means that if there are three classes: A, B, and C, and C is supposed to inherit from A and B, it cannot do so at the same time. This is because if A and B both have a method with the same name and the child class object tries to call it, there may be confusion on whether to call the method of A or B.</p>
<p>Java programming language is designed to produce better compile-time errors rather than runtime errors. Therefore, if you try to inherit 2 classes in Java, there will be a compile-time error regardless of whether the methods in the classes are the same or different.</p>

<h3 class="h3">61) What is aggregation? </h3>
<p>Aggregation is a type of relationship between two classes in which one class owns and refers to another class. This kind of relationship is often described by the phrase "has-a." An example of aggregation is an Employee class that contains fields such as name, age, and salary, as well as an object of the Address class with fields such as Address-Line 1, City, State, and pin-code. In other words, the Employee class has an instance of the Address class.</p>
<p><strong>Address.java</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">public class Address {
String city,state,country;

public Address(String city, String state, String country) {

<h3 class="h3">62) What is composition? </h3>
<p> Holding the reference of a class within some other class is known as composition. When an object contains the other object, if the contained object cannot exist without the existence of container object, then it is called composition. In other words, we can say that composition is the particular case of aggregation which represents a stronger relationship between two objects.
Example: A class contains students. A student cannot exist without a class. There exists composition between class and students. </p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">63) What is the difference between aggregation and composition? </h3>
<p>Aggregation and composition are two types of relationships between objects in object-oriented programming. Aggregation represents a relationship where one object contains or uses another object, but the two objects can exist independently of each other. On the other hand, composition represents a stronger relationship where one object (the whole) is composed of smaller objects (the parts), and the smaller objects cannot exist without the larger object. For example, a bike's indicator is an example of aggregation since it can be removed or replaced independently of the bike. In contrast, the bike's engine is an example of composition since it is an essential part of the bike, and the bike cannot function without it.</p>

<h3 class="h3">64) Why does Java not support pointers? </h3>
<p>In programming, a pointer is a type of variable that stores a memory address. However, Java does not utilize pointers due to their potential security risks and intricate nature.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">65) What is super in java?</h3>
<p>In Java programming, the keyword 'super' functions as a reference variable for the object of the immediate parent class. It is useful in referring to the parent object when creating an instance of the subclass. The compiler automatically creates an instance of the parent class, which is then referred to by the 'super' keyword in the subclass. If there's no reference to 'super' or 'this' in a class constructor, the compiler will automatically call 'super()'.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class Animal{

<h3 class="h3">67) What are the main uses of the super keyword?</h3>
<p>The super keyword is utilized in the following ways.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>You can utilize the keyword "super" to refer to the instance variable of the parent class that is directly above the current class.</li>
<li>One way to call the method of the immediate parent class is by using the keyword "super".</li>
<li>The super() function allows the programmer to call the constructor of the immediate parent class.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">68) What are the differences between this and super keyword?</h3>
<p>The following distinctions exist between "this" and the "super" keyword.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The super keyword is used to refer to the context of the parent class, while the this keyword is used to refer to the context of the current class.</li>
<li>The purpose of the super keyword is to set the base class variables in the derived class constructor, while the purpose of the this keyword is to differentiate local variables from instance variables when passing them into the class constructor.</li>
<li>To ensure proper implementation of a constructor, the 'super' and 'this' keywords must be the first statements within the code block. Failure to do this will result in a compile-time error.</li>
</ul>

<div class="codeblock3"><pre>Person class constructor called
Employee class constructor called
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<p>If you don't include the super() or this() method within the constructor of a derived class, the compiler will implicitly invoke the super() method. This means that the constructor of the parent class, i.e., Person in this case, will be called first followed by the constructor of the derived class, i.e., Employee.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">70) Can you use this() and super() both in a constructor?</h3>
<p>The original content states that using this() and super() anywhere other than at the beginning of the class constructor is not allowed. This means that these statements must be the first ones in the constructor. To rephrase it: The use of this() and super() is only valid at the beginning of the class constructor and cannot be implemented elsewhere in the constructor code.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">public class Test{

<h3 class="h3">83) Can we override the private methods?</h3>
<p>Certainly, here's a rephrased version: 

Private methods in a class have a limited scope as they are only accessible from within that class. As a result, it is not possible to override these methods from outside the class.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">84) Can we change the scope of the overridden method in the subclass?</h3>
<p>Certainly. It's possible to alter the scope of an overridden method in a subclass; however, it's important to note that the accessibility of the method cannot be decreased. Therefore, it's crucial to consider this aspect when making any adjustments to the method's accessibility.</p>
<ul class="points">

<p>Certainly, I can rephrase the content for you. It is possible to alter the throws clause in the superclass method while implementing it in the subclass. However, there are guidelines that must be adhered to when it comes to managing exceptions in the overridden method.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>If the method in a superclass does not declare an exception, it is not allowed for the overridden method in a subclass to declare a checked exception. However, the subclass method is permitted to declare an unchecked exception.</li>

<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class Base 
{
    public void baseMethod()
    {
        System.out.println("BaseMethod called ...");

    }
}
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<p> Output 
</p><div class="codeblock3"><pre>Derived method called ...
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<p>
The method of Base class, i.e., baseMethod() is overridden in Derived class. In Test class, the reference variable b (of type Base class) refers to the instance of the Derived class. Here, Runtime polymorphism is achieved between class Base and Derived. At compile time, the presence of method baseMethod checked in Base class, If it presence then the program compiled otherwise the compiler error will be shown. In this case, baseMethod is present in Base class; therefore, it is compiled successfully. However, at runtime, It checks whether the baseMethod has been overridden by Derived class, if so then the Derived class method is called otherwise Base class method is called. In this case, the Derived class overrides the baseMethod; therefore, the Derived class method is called.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Core Java - OOPs Concepts: final keyword Interview Questions</h2>
</div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">90) What is the final variable?</h3>
<p>The use of the final keyword in Java is aimed at limiting the user’s ability to modify the assigned value of a variable. Once a value has been set to a final variable, it cannot be changed. If a final variable has not been assigned a value during declaration, it can only be assigned through the class constructor.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java"> class Bike9{
  final int speedlimit=90;//final variable

  Bike9 obj=new  Bike9();
  obj.run();
  }

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">91) What is the final method?</h3>
<p>When a method is marked as final, it cannot be overridden, leading to a restriction on modifying its behavior.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class Bike{
  final void run(){System.out.println("running");}
}
   
class Honda extends Bike{
   void run(){System.out.println("running safely with 100kmph");}
   
   public static void main(String args[]){
   Honda honda= new Honda();
   honda.run();
   }
}

<div class="codeblock3"><pre>Output:Compile Time Error
</pre></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">92) What is the final class?</h3>
<p>When a class is marked as final, it cannot be inherited by any subclass.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java"> final class Bike{}
 
 class Honda1 extends Bike{
   void run(){System.out.println("running safely with 100kmph");}
   
   public static void main(String args[]){
   Honda1 honda= new Honda1();

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">93) What is the final blank variable?</h3>
<p>When we declare a variable as final but don't give it an initial value, it's known as a final blank variable. We cannot directly assign a value to it but instead, we can initialize it using the class constructor. This type of variable is useful when we want to prevent others from changing certain data that belong to a user. For instance, a PAN Number. Here is an illustration:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class Student{
int id;
String name;
final String PAN_CARD_NUMBER;
...
}

</textarea></div>
<a href="final-keyword.html">More Details.</a>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">94) Can we initialize the final blank variable?</h3>
<p>Certainly! If a variable is not considered static, it can be initialized within a constructor. However, if a variable is classified as a static blank final variable, it can only be initialized within a static block. For further information, please consult the relevant documentation.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">95) Can you declare the main method as final? </h3>
<p>Certainly! It is possible to declare the main method using the format "public static final void main(String[] args){}". This means that the method can be accessed from outside its class, it does not return a value, and it cannot be overridden by any subclasses.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">96) What is the output of the following Java program?</h3>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class Main {
 public static void main(String args[]){
   final int i;
   i = 20;
   System.out.println(i);
 }
}
</textarea></div>
<p> Output 
</p><div class="codeblock3"><pre>20
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<p>The output of the following code block will be 20, since the variable 'i' is a final variable that has been initialized with the value 20. As a result, 'i' can only be initialized one time and its value cannot be changed.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">97) What is the output of the following Java program?</h3>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class Base 
{
    protected final void getInfo()
    {
        System.out.println("method of Base class");
    }
}
 
public class Derived extends Base
{
    protected final void getInfo()
    {
        System.out.println("method of Derived class");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Base obj = new Base();
        obj.getInfo();
    }
}
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>	Derived.java:11: error: getInfo() in Derived cannot override getInfo() in Base
    protected final void getInfo()
                         ^
  overridden method is final
1 error
</pre></div>
<p> Explanation 
</p><p>The final keyword is used in the getDetails() method, thereby preventing it from being overridden by any subclass.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">98) Can we declare a constructor as final?</h3>
<p>It is not possible to declare constructors as final since they cannot be inherited. Unlike ordinary methods, constructors are unique and serve a different purpose. Therefore, declaring a constructor as final does not make sense, and attempting to do so will result in a compiler error.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">99) Can we declare an interface as final?</h3>
<p>It is not possible to mark an interface as final since an interface needs to be implemented by a class to define its functionality. Therefore, making an interface final would not make sense. While attempting to do so, the compiler would throw an error.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">100) What is the difference between the final method and abstract method?</h3>
<p>The essential dissimilarity between the final method and the abstract method lies in the fact that an abstract method cannot be declared as final because it needs to be implemented in a subclass to give its meaning.</p>
