<hr>
<h3 class="h3">5) What are the different roles in Scrum?</h3>
<p>There are three distinct roles in the Scrum framework:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Product Owner:</strong> The first role is the product owner. This is an individual responsible for increasing the ROI by determining product features, prioritizing these features into a list, focusing on the upcoming sprint, and other things. These are constantly re-prioritized and refined.</li>
<li><strong>Scrum Master:</strong> The Scrum Master is used to help the team learn how to apply Scrum to ensure optimum business value. The responsibility of scrum master is to remove impediments, shield the team from distractions, and make them able to adopt agile practices.</li>
<li><strong>Scrum Team:</strong> The Scrum Team is a collection of individuals who work together to ensure the stakeholders' requirements on time.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">6) What are the main responsibilities of the Scrum Team?</h3>
<p>The Scrum Team is a group of individuals who organize themselves and work together on a project. This team usually consists of a minimum of five members and a maximum of seven members, but is always less than ten members.</p>
<p>Here are the main duties that Scrum Teams are accountable for:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Delivering functional products is a crucial aspect of every sprint and must be prioritized.</li>
<li>It is essential to make sure that the team members have clear ownership and transparency over their assigned tasks.</li>
<li>For a successful daily scrum meeting, the Scrum Team needs to provide precise and accurate information.</li>
<li>Effective teamwork relies on the cooperation and coordination of all team members.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">7) What is the difference between Agile and Scrum?</h3>
<p>Here's a paraphrased version:

Agile and Scrum are two development methodologies that have some key differences. Some of the differences include: 

- Agile is a broader methodology that involves being flexible and open to change throughout the development process, while Scrum is a specific framework within Agile that focuses on iterative development and daily meetings called "standups."
- Agile is more of a philosophy or mindset, while Scrum is a more structured and prescriptive approach to development.
- Agile emphasizes collaboration and teamwork among all members of the project, whereas Scrum puts a lot of emphasis on the role of the Scrum Master, who acts as an intermediary between the development team and stakeholders.
- Agile is often used in large-scale projects, while Scrum is more commonly used in smaller teams or projects.</p>

<h3 class="h3">8) What are some other frameworks of Agile rather than Scrum?</h3>
<p>There exist various alternative Agile frameworks in addition to Scrum, such as feature-driven development, test-driven development, and kanban (which makes use of kanban boards).</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">9) What are the Artifacts of the Scrum Process?</h3>
<p>The Scrum process involves three primary artifacts, which are discussed below:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Product Backlog:</strong> The Product Backlog is a list that contains new features, changes to features, bug fixes, changes to the infrastructure, and other activities to ensure that we can get an individual output.</li>
<li><strong>Sprint Backlog:</strong> The Sprint Backlog is a subset of the Product Backlog. It contains tasks that the team has focused on to satisfy the sprint goal. Teams first identify the tasks that they have completed from the product backlog and then added them to the sprint backlog.</li>
<li><strong>Product Increment:</strong> Product Increment is a combination of all product backlog items completed in a sprint and the value of previous sprints' increments. The output must be in a usable condition without minding it if the product owner doesn't release it.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">10) What are the key differences between Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog?</h3>
<p>Here are the main distinctions between the Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog:</p>
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Product Backlog</th>
<th>Sprint Backlog</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Product Backlog refers to the inventory of tasks, features, and requirements that need to be accomplished in order to create the final product.</td>
<td>The Sprint Backlog is a compilation of tasks that need to be accomplished within a specific sprint duration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The product owner is responsible for gathering customer feedback and compiling a backlog of tasks, which are then assigned to the team members in order to prioritize implementation.</td>
<td>The Sprint Backlog is a process where the team gathers the items to be worked on from the product owner and establishes the duration for the Sprint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The model is tailored to meet the customer's vision.</td>
<td>The answer to this question is not set in stone and depends on the product vision that has been established by the product owner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The content needs to be restated in a different way so that it does not copy the original source. One possible rephrased version could be: "The objective is clearly defined and there is a definite plan in place to achieve it."</td>
<td>This content describes a task that is exclusively related to a particular sprint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The sprint goal is independent of the sprint backlog.</td>
<td>The answer would vary based on the product backlog of the project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Product Backlog is managed by the product owner throughout the duration of the project until its completion.</td>
<td>The Sprint Backlog is a list of tasks that a team adds to for each new Sprint. It is an important tool for keeping track of the work that needs to be done in each iteration of the project.</td>
</tr>

The prioritization of user stories is represented on the horizontal axis, while the vertical axis highlights an increase in sophistication.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">19) Who writes user stories? </h3>
<p>In agile development, the person responsible for creating and maintaining the product backlog is typically the product owner. However, this doesn't mean that only the product owner can write user stories. Anyone on the team can create user stories.</p>
<p><strong>A possible rephrasing of the original content could be:

Describing user stories is an iterative process that involves gathering requirements and feedback from stakeholders. This usually starts with identifying the actors, goals and context of the system or feature being developed. From there, user stories are written in a simple, structured format that captures the user's need, the action they take and the outcome. As the development progresses, the user stories are refined and updated based on user testing, user feedback, system constraints and priorities. This ongoing refinement process ensures that the user stories remain relevant and valuable throughout the project.</strong></p>
<p>The team initiates product discussions and captures requirements as user stories. The product backlog remains dynamic, allowing anyone to add a new requirement that they feel could bring value to the client. There is no specific role designated to write user stories, as long as the writer understands the format and the meaning behind it.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">20) What are the advantages of writing user stories?</h3>
<p>Writing user stories during Agile development offers numerous benefits, including a sense of ownership among team members. This is because being involved in the writing process helps team members connect with the development process. User stories can be written at any point during Agile development.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">21) What do you understand by 'Scrum of Scrums'? </h3>
<p>The 'Scrum of Scrums' refers to a set of agile techniques used to manage and coordinate multiple scrum teams working on complex projects. It is a useful approach when dealing with collaborative assignments that require efficient control and collaboration between teams.</p>
<p>Implementing an agile software development methodology guarantees that the necessary communication, cooperation, flexibility, and acceptance are achieved, and the products are effectively rolled out and handed over.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">22) What is the general age of the Sprints?</h3>
<p>A sprint is a time-boxed period during which a product increment that can be released is developed. This period usually lasts for a month or less, although it can be shorter. Sprints can also be as brief as one or two weeks on average.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">23) What do you understand by a Sprint Retrospective?</h3>
<p>The sprint retrospective meeting is held post the sprint review, where team members reflect on their previous performance, identify errors, anticipate challenges, and brainstorm new strategies for surpassing them. This information is subsequently used to plan for the next sprint.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">24) What are the main drawbacks or disadvantages of using Scrum?</h3>
<p>Here are some major drawbacks or limitations of implementing Scrum methodology:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Scrum is a methodology that requires competent and skilled team members.</li>
<li>The success of a Scrum team relies on their ability to work together effectively and their dedication to delivering accurate results.</li>

<h3 class="h3">33) What are the different types of risks in Scrum? How can you handle them?</h3>
<p>Below listed are crucial categories of risks that may arise in Scrum:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>This information suggests the possibility of going over budget and the associated risks.</li>
<li>The statement emphasizes that the team should consist of individuals possessing the necessary aptitude and expertise.</li>
<li>A sprint is a technique used to define the length of a project cycle and the tasks to be completed within that cycle.</li>

<h4 class="n">Note: It is essential to understand that the risk's impact is based on the proximity of the actual occurrence of the risk.</h4>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">34) What are the full form of MVP and MMP? What is their usage? </h3>
<p>MVP is an acronym that stands for Minimum Viable Product. The concept of MVP is often used in the Lean Startup methodology, highlighting the importance of learning while developing a product. By creating an initial version of their product and exposing it to potential customers or users, entrepreneurs can gather relevant data and gain insight into their target audience. This approach allows for testing and understanding of an idea before investing too much time and resources in its development. By observing how customers use and perceive the product, entrepreneurs can gain a better understanding of their needs and expectations.</p>
<p>The term MMP, or Minimal Marketable Product, refers to a description of a product that includes only the most essential features necessary to meet the needs of users. This approach helps businesses shorten their time to market while still satisfying their customers.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">35) Is Scrum Master a management-level position?</h3>
<p>While the Scrum Master is a position that has management-level responsibilities, it differs from a typical manager role. The Scrum Master is responsible for managing the Scrum process rather than managing the Scrum Team or Development Team. In cases where the Scrum Master is not in a management position, they may lack the authority to address impediments.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">36) How does a Scrum Master track the progress of the Sprint?</h3>

<li>Risk review</li>
<li>Risk closure</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">38) What does the "Definition of Ready" contains?</h3>
<p>The "Definition of Ready" is an agreement that is established between the Product Owner and the team to determine what readiness means for the backlog items. The team cannot start working on the items from the product backlog until they are in a ready state and can be picked up for the sprint. Therefore, the team must identify the specific requirements for the User Story or PBI and the amount of work necessary to complete it. Each team and product may have its own unique Definition of Ready.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">39) What are the parameters to define the ready state for a User Story? </h3>
<p>Here are some criteria that can be utilized to describe when a User Story is in a Ready state:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>For a development team to work on a particular task, the corresponding Product Backlog Item (PBI) must be in an approved or equivalent state.</li>
<li>The team needs to recognize and document any interdependencies between the User Stories.</li>
<li>It is important for the team to have a clear understanding of the acceptance criteria and for them to be established.</li>
<li>Acceptance criteria need to be detailed enough to guide the team in the development and testing of the features.</li>
<li>The team needs to be provided with performance criteria so that they can fully understand it.</li>
<li>To avoid plagiarism, the following statement can be rewritten: "It is recommended to write the Product Backlog Item (PBI) in the format of Actor-&gt;Action-&gt;Outcome to clearly identify the user, the specific action to be performed, and the expected result."</li>
<li>The group must understand the significance of demonstrating the User Story.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">40) What does DoD mean? What is its usage?</h3>
<p>DoD is an abbreviation for "Definition of Done," which outlines a set of requirements that must be fulfilled for a task to be considered completed. This set includes various deliverables such as written codes, unit tests, integration testing, design documents, comments on coding, release notes, and more. It is essentially a quality checklist for work. The DoD aids in determining whether a task from the sprint backlog has been accomplished satisfactorily.</p>
<p>The Definition of Done (DoD) can aid the Scrum methodology by defining the specific tasks and objectives that must be accomplished to successfully complete a project. By outlining achievable deliverables, the DoD helps to keep the team on track and ensures that the project stays aligned with its goals.</p>
<p><strong>The subsequent rundown highlights the critical applications of this product.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>To explain the necessary actions needed to execute the iteration.</li>
<li>One way to improve the effectiveness of a project is to use suitable tools like burndown charts.</li>
<li>To guarantee prompt and consistent communication throughout the project's duration.</li>
<li>One way to ensure the proper comprehension of the product backlog items is to conduct a walkthrough of them.</li>
<li>To guarantee that the Department of Defense is focused on completing specific tasks.</li>
<li>Reworded: One way to develop a checklist for the items in the product backlog is by following a particular process.</li>
<li>Ensuring the active participation of the product owner in reviewing processes during the Sprint and sprint retrospective.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">41) What do you understand by the term "Servant Leader"? How can a Scrum Master be a Servant Leader?</h3>
<p>The concept of a "Servant Leader" emphasizes a leader's dedication to serving others. As a Scrum Master, one must play various roles such as being a mentor, facilitator, and guide. This enables the team to feel more empowered and engaged throughout the project.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">42) How can you coordinate between multiple teams?</h3>
<p>There are many approaches to coordinate between multiple teams. One of the most common strategies for this is the Scrum of Scrums (SoS) meeting. In this meeting, the members representing each scrum team discuss the progress, performance, issues, risks, etc. The team should pre-define the frequency of these meetings. Generally, scrum masters would represent a particular scrum team, besides having the Chief Scrum Master (whose responsibility is coordination &amp; collaboration among all the scrums) who facilitates these meetings. </p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">43) How can a Scrum Master increase the productivity of the development team? </h3>
<p>As a facilitator, Scrum Masters are equipped to improve team productivity by enabling decision-making and eliminating roadblocks. It's essential to note that Scrum Masters are not team managers, but they play a supportive role by advocating for the team's choices and removing distractions that may hinder progress.</p>
