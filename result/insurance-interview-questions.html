<h1 class="h1">Top 35 Most Asked Insurance Interview Questions and Answers</h1>
<h3 class="h3">1) What is Insurance?</h3>
<p>Insurance is a contract between individuals or organizations and an insurance company. This contract is represented by a policy that provides protection from financial loss. It's a form of risk management that helps reduce the risk of an uncertain loss. Through insurance, individuals or organizations can manage their risks by purchasing protection against unexpected financial losses. If a covered event occurs, the insurance company pays out a contractual amount to the policyholder in accordance with the terms of the policy.</p>
<p>Having insurance is important as it provides financial coverage or compensation for losses incurred by an insured individual or entity. In case of an accident or unforeseen event, insurance can safeguard individuals from bearing the costs associated with it. Those who lack insurance may face significant financial liabilities if an accident occurs. Therefore, it's advisable to obtain appropriate insurance coverage.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">2) What do you understand by an insurance policy? </h3>
<p>The insurance contract, also known as the insurance policy, involves a written agreement between the policyholder and the Insurance provider. The Insurance provider is an entity or organization that supplies insurance, alternatively referred to as an underwriter or insurance company, while the purchaser of the insurance is known as the policyholder.</p>
<p>Insurance is primarily utilized to protect against potential financial losses that may arise from various situations. These losses can be significant or minor, and can result from damage to the insured party or their belongings, or from liability for harm caused to a third party.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">3) What do you understand by the term "insurance coverage"?</h3>
<p>Insurance coverage refers to an agreement between an insurance company and an individual where the insurer agrees to cover the insured things in exchange for a specific amount of premium paid by the policyholder. The policy specifies the points of the agreement, and the insurance company is obligated to pay the insured in case of damage or claims made according to the terms of the insurance policy. The insured party pays premiums to the insurance company, which determines the insurance coverage benefits.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">4) What are the different types of Insurance Coverage?</h3>
<p>There exist two primary categories of insurances that individuals can avail for their protection:</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Life Insurance</li>
<li>General or non-life insurance refers to a type of insurance that provides coverage for individuals, organizations, or properties against damages or losses that may occur due to unexpected events such as accidents, natural disasters, or theft. This type of insurance typically covers a wide range of categories, including health, property, liability, and travel insurance, among others. Its main objective is to offer financial protection to policyholders by reimbursing the costs associated with unforeseen events.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">5) What is a premium? How does an insurance company determine the premium?</h3>
<p>A premium is the amount that a policyholder pays for an insurance contract with an insurance company. It's the cost of protection against any potential loss, damage, or danger. Premiums are paid on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis, depending on the insurance plan, in exchange for the coverage that the policyholder has purchased from the insurance company.</p>
<p>The origin of the term "premium" can be traced back to its Latin root word "praemium," which denotes a "reward" or "prize."</p>
<p>Insurance premiums are based on the level of risk associated with the insured item or person. The more likely it is for a loss or setback to occur, the higher the premium will be. On the other hand, lower risk items or people will likely have lower premiums due to their reduced likelihood of experiencing loss or damage.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">6) What do you understand by the term "Beneficiary"?</h3>
<p>A "Beneficiary" is the individual who is selected to receive the insured amount if the policyholder passes away.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">7) What is the key difference between "revocable beneficiary" and "irrevocable beneficiary" in insurance?</h3>
<p>The term "revocable beneficiary" is used to describe a situation where the policyholder has the freedom to change the name of the beneficiary without their permission. However, with an "irrevocable beneficiary," the policyholder must obtain consent from the beneficiary before changing their name. This means that even if the policyholder has paid premiums and purchased the insurance, they cannot change the name of the beneficiary without their agreement.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">8) What do you understand by "Insured" and "Insurer"?</h3>
<p>In the world of insurance, the words 'Insured' and 'Insurer' are commonly used. The 'Insured' refers to the individual or company that holds the policy, while the 'Insurer' is the specific company that provides coverage for the Insured and is responsible for paying out any compensation.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">9) What do you understand by the "contestable period" in an insurance policy?</h3>
<p>The "contestable period" in an insurance policy typically refers to a specific duration, usually lasting one or two years, during which the insurer has the authority to scrutinize both the policy and the policyholder before deciding whether or not to disburse the insurance claim.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">10) What do you understand by no-claim bonus? What are its main benefits?</h3>
<p>An NCB or no-claim bonus is a special benefit given to policyholders who have not made any insurance claims in the previous year. It is a form of reward or incentive for being a responsible and careful insurer.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of having a no-claim bonus</strong></p>
<p>The benefits of having a no-claim bonus include several advantages.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Having a no-claims history has a significant impact on reducing your yearly insurance costs. When you don't file a claim on your auto insurance policy, your insurance provider won't have to pay out any money. This demonstrates to them that you are less risky to insure and therefore, a potential candidate for lower premiums in the future.</li>
<li>The no-claim bonus is a benefit that remains with you even if you choose to sell your current car. This means that you can transfer it to the next car you purchase.</li>
<li>If you decide to switch to a different insurance provider, you can easily transfer your no-claim bonus without any hassle.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">11) What should you keep in mind while buying an insurance policy?</h3>
<p>When considering purchasing an insurance policy, it's important to keep certain factors in mind.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>It's important to assess the market value of your vehicle before buying an insurance policy. If you've bought a new vehicle, the insured value will be equal to its purchase price.</li>
<li>It's important to disclose all pertinent information regarding your vehicle when obtaining insurance coverage. This includes any prior accidents the vehicle has been involved in, as well as any changes made to the original engine. If you're unsure about any details, consider reaching out to your previous insurance provider for clarification.</li>
<li>It's important to make sure that your vehicle is adequately insured, as this can have an impact on the amount you can receive in the event of a claim.</li>
<li>There is a wide range of insurance companies that offer coverage for vehicles. You have various options to choose from by comparing premiums and selecting the one that suits your needs.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">12) What do you understand by the "declaration page" in the insurance policy?</h3>
<p>A declaration page is a legal record that includes all the details of the policyholder, such as their address, name, vehicle information, type of coverage, and loss payee information. This document is periodically updated whenever changes are made to the policy during the term. An updated declaration page will be sent to the policyholder if any new endorsements are added.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">13) What are the different types of benefits included in a personal accident policy?</h3>
<p>Here is an alternative way to describe it:

A personal accident policy typically includes a range of benefits and coverage for policyholders. These may vary depending on the specific policy, but some common examples include...</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Accidental death</li>
<li>Any form of permanent disability resulting from an unforeseen incident.</li>
<li>Short-term impairment (whether partial or complete, depending on the insurance policy you have).</li>
<li>Hospitalization benefits.</li>
<li>Medical expenses.</li>
<li>This refers to surgeries that are performed due to accidents or to correct a certain condition.</li>
<li>Funeral expenses etc.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">14) What do you understand by "Loss Payee"?</h3>
<p>The Loss Payee clause in an insurance policy refers to the person or bank that receives the insurance payment after the policyholder experiences a loss of their property or vehicle. This clause is mandated by law and is used to protect other parties or banks who have invested in the policyholder's property or vehicle. For instance, if a person has a car on loan and they have insured it, but the car is completely damaged beyond repair in an accident, the bank that lent them the money is still owed money. When the policyholder files an insurance claim, the insurer will pay the money directly to the person or bank to whom they owe money, i.e., the Loss Payee.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">15) What do you understand by "Deductible" in Insurance? Why is it added to insurance? </h3>
<p>A deductible is the predetermined sum that a policyholder is required to pay out of their own pocket before the insurance company will begin covering costs. Essentially, the insurance company is only responsible for paying out if the claim amount exceeds the deductible.</p>
<p><strong>The inclusion of a deductible is a common practice in insurance for several reasons.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>A deductible is a term included in insurance policies to indicate a certain limit that must be met before the insurance company will start paying for expenses. Typically, this is used in health insurance and travel insurance as a threshold for payment.</li>
<li>The clause known as "anti-fraud provision" is commonly included in health insurance policies to prevent fraudulent activities and to ensure that policyholders make legitimate claims, rather than attempting to scam the insurance company.</li>
<li>If you have a health insurance policy of 50,000 rupees that has a deductible of 10,000 rupees, you will be responsible for paying the first 10,000 rupees when you receive hospital treatment. The remaining amount of 40,000 rupees will only be paid by the insurance company directly to the hospital after the deductible has been paid.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">16) What do you understand by the term "Annuity"?</h3>
<p>An annuity is a type of insurance policy that guarantees the policyholder a fixed income for a specific period or their entire lifetime. The policyholder receives a predetermined amount of money annually, which is agreed upon in the contract between the policyholder and the insurance company. The insurance company is responsible for paying the amount either immediately or after a specified time frame as outlined in the policy terms.</p>
<p>This type of insurance policy provides regular payments to policyholders on a monthly or quarterly basis. It serves as a valuable source of income for individuals during retirement years, ensuring they can continue to cover basic living expenses.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">17) What are the main reasons behind buying travel insurance? / Why is it important to get travel insurance?</h3>
<p>When traveling with your family, particularly to another country, purchasing travel insurance is crucial. This is because it can provide coverage for various risks such as medical emergencies, flight disruptions, and travel-related issues. It's an important investment that can offer peace of mind during your travels.</p>
<p>The subsequent catalog delineates the primary justifications for obtaining travel insurance:</p>
<p><strong>Travel insurance provides protection from common risks that may occur while traveling.</strong></p>
<p>Travel insurance offers several benefits for travellers. One of the main advantages is that it provides coverage for potential risks that may occur during travel. This includes loss of personal belongings, passports, and checked-in baggage. By having travel insurance, individuals can have an additional layer of protection against financial loss. For instance, if a flight is cancelled, a travel insurance policy can provide compensation up to a certain limit as per the policy's terms and conditions. Not having travel insurance could be an expensive experience for the individual.</p>
<p><strong>The topic addressed is concerning medical emergencies that can occur while traveling.</strong></p>
<p>Travel insurance is a type of coverage that helps to cover the expenses of medical treatment you may need while you are away from home. The insurance policy provides protection for various levels of medical emergencies during your travels up to a certain amount. If you encounter any medical emergencies while traveling, the insurance company will compensate for the medical or accident treatment costs up to a specific limit. To ensure that you receive the appropriate medical treatment, insurance companies have a list of authorized hospitals where you can be treated.</p>
<p><strong>Travel insurance provides coverage for unexpected disruptions during a trip.</strong></p>
<p>If you encounter any unexpected issues during your travel that force you to cancel or cut short your trip, then your travel insurance policy will provide coverage for any expenses resulting from cancelled bookings, trip curtailments, and other similar situations, as specified in the terms and conditions of your policy.</p>
<p><strong>This means that insurance is beneficial for those who hold policies.</strong></p>
<p>Travel insurance companies offer various forms of assistance in the case of unforeseen issues during your vacation. This includes providing guidance on how to file insurance claims properly and finding a suitable hospital within their network for medical treatment.</p>
<p>Travel insurance offers a range of benefits for travelers. It provides coverage for unforeseen circumstances such as cancellation, medical emergencies, and accidents. Additionally, travel insurance can also assist in situations where baggage, personal belongings, and money are lost, passports are misplaced, and delays occur. The policy also covers personal liability, hijacking incidents, and repatriation.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">18) What do you understand by the term Co-insurance?</h3>
<p>Co-insurance is a type of insurance policy that is commonly provided by health insurance companies. With this type of policy, policyholders are required to share the coverage with the insurance company based on a percentage of the policy value, after meeting the deductible or co-payment obligation. Generally, this involves an 80/20 split, where the policyholder pays 20% of the covered expenses, while the insurance company covers the remaining 80%.</p>
<p>Let's say that you've purchased a health insurance plan with a sum insured value of 120000 rupees and a deductible amount of 20000. This means that you will need to pay the deductible before your insurance kicks in. After paying the deductible, the remaining amount that your insurance company will cover is 100000. If your plan includes a co-insurance clause of 80/20, this means that you will be responsible for paying 20% of the remaining amount out of your own pocket (which works out to be 20000 rupees), while your insurance provider will cover the remaining 80% (equivalent to 80000 rupees).</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">19) What are the different types of examples of Insurance?</h3>
<p>The following is a compilation of the most frequent kinds of insurance that are offered in the industry.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Life insurance</li>
<li>Medical and health insurance are types of insurance policies that provide coverage for medical expenses incurred by policyholders. These policies cover a range of medical expenses, including hospitalization fees, medical tests, surgeries, and other associated fees. These insurance policies are designed to help policyholders manage the financial burden of medical treatments and procedures.</li>
<li>Personal accidental Insurance</li>
<li>Travel insurance</li>
<li>Retirement annuity insurance</li>
<li>Home and property insurance is a type of insurance policy that is designed to protect your home and its contents against loss or damage. This type of insurance typically covers a wide range of risks, including fire, theft, natural disasters, and other unforeseen events that may result in damage to your property. With home and property insurance, you can have peace of mind knowing that your home is protected, and you won't have to shoulder the full financial burden in the event of a loss.</li>
<li>Investment-linked Insurance etc.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">20) What do you understand by the Surrender Value?</h3>
<p>Surrender value refers to the amount of money a policyholder will receive if they choose to terminate their life insurance policy prior to maturity. Unfortunately, this will result in a loss for the policyholder as they do not meet the requirements set forth by the insurance company. The surrender value may also be referred to as surrender cash value or annuity surrender value in the case of annuities.</p>
<p>Let's say you've invested 15,000 rupees in an insurance policy over a period of three years, paying 5,000 rupees annually for a 1.5 lakh rupee sum assured. If you decide to terminate the policy before it matures, the minimum surrender value you can receive is 30% of the total premiums paid, which comes out to be 3,000 rupees.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">21) What do you understand by Paid Value?</h3>
<p>The paid value is the sum of money that a policyholder receives when their insurance policy matures, and they have stopped making premium payments but have not withdrawn the amount. The insurer guarantees this payment, which is reduced proportionally based on the duration the policyholder stopped paying the premiums.</p>
<p>The paid-up value of an insurance policy is the reduced amount that remains active when the policyholder stops paying premiums after a specific duration. The deduction from the matured amount is determined by the timing of the request for the paid value before the maturity period.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">22) What do you understand by the term "Loss Payee"?</h3>
<p>A Loss Payee is a person, entity, or institution that receives an insurance payment if they suffer a loss of their owned vehicle or property. If a loss occurs, the policyholder's insurance payment goes to the Loss Payee instead of the policyholder.</p>
<p>Loan protection insurance is a type of policy that offers financial security to the borrower's lender, ensuring they are protected against unpaid loans. For instance, if you've purchased a vehicle on loan and opted for car insurance, in the event of an accident during the loan repayment period, the money would be paid to the lending institution instead of your personal account.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">23) Is it a good idea to replace the policy with another policy with better returns?</h3>
<p>Whether or not it is wise to replace an insurance policy with a new one depends on the circumstances. If you recently purchased the policy, it may be beneficial to replace it with a policy that offers better returns. However, if you have had the policy for a long time and paid many premiums, it is not recommended to replace it, as you will lose the advantages of the original policy and the premium will likely increase as you age. Additionally, the two-year contestability period will restart if you get a new policy.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">24) What is the procedure to claim an insurance policy?</h3>
<p>If you have taken out an insurance policy, there are several steps you can take to make a claim.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>You will need to complete the necessary paperwork to file an insurance claim.</li>
<li>To initiate the claims process for your insurance policy, the first step is to gather all necessary documents and information related to the incident. Then, reach out to the financial advisor who sold you the policy for guidance and assistance.</li>
<li>After the initial step of selecting the insurance plan, you will need to provide the necessary documentation requested by the insurance company, including the payment receipt and any other required documents.</li>
<li>Once your documents are confirmed, you will be required to make a payment for the necessary penalties. After that, you will receive your insurance claim within a certain timeframe. Typically, it takes around seven to ten days from the date you submitted your claim.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">25) What would happen if an insurance policyholder fails to make required premium payments? / What happens if a person doesn't pay premium payments?</h3>
<p>Most insurers offer a grace period of around 10-15 days to their policyholders if they are unable to pay their insurance premium before the due date. However, if they fail to pay even in the grace period, their policy will become void. In such a scenario, to reinstate the policy, they will need to pay the due premium amount along with interest charges as applicable. The process of renewing a lapsed policy can differ across insurance providers.</p>
<p>If a policyholder fails to pay their premium after a few months of buying insurance, the insurance company terminates the policy after a notice is given. However, if premium payments were made for a significant period of time, usually more than two or three years, and they stop paying, the insurance company will deduct the premium payments from the accumulated sum until there's no fund left. This practice is standard with permanent life insurance policies.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">26) What is the difference between a participating policy and a non-participating policy?</h3>
<p>Here's a possible rephrased version:

A participating policy and a non-participating policy show a significant contrast. The main difference between them is that one provides policyholders with the opportunity to receive bonuses, while the other doesn't.</p>
<p>When policyholders opt for participating policies, they become entitled to receive a portion of the generated profit from the insurance company in the form of dividends. The insurance company shares the profits earned with its policyholders.</p>
<p>In a participating policy, policyholders receive a share of the company's profits. However, in a non-participating policy, policyholders don't receive any portion of the company's profits.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">27) Can a beneficiary claim the insurance policy if the insurance policyholder has been missing for multiple years?</h3>
<p>Adding a beneficiary to an insurance policy is a solution introduced to address situations where the policyholder passes away unexpectedly or has been missing for an extended period. The beneficiary can be entitled to claim the insurance policy in such cases, provided certain conditions are met.</p>
<p><strong>The following set of circumstances must be met:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>To claim the life insurance policy of a missing policyholder, the recipient must acquire a legal document from a court that confirms the individual has been absent for a prolonged amount of time, usually more than seven years.</li>
<li>The first requirement for a person to be considered legally dead is that their brain has permanently ceased to function. The second requirement is that there must be a legal announcement of their death.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">28) Is it safe to pay the premium through an insurance agent? / Can an insurance policyholder pay the premium through an insurance agent? Is it safe to do so?</h3>
<p>In India, it is generally considered safe to pay insurance premiums through an agent. However, it is important to exercise caution and ensure that necessary precautions are taken while doing so.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>It is recommended for policyholders to settle their insurance premium payments through cheques issued specifically to their insurance provider.</li>
<li>Policyholders should obtain receipts for all payments made towards their premiums.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">29) What do you understand by a general insurance policy? What does it cover?</h3>
<p>India offers two main categories of insurance policies: life insurance and general insurance. The general insurance, also known as non-life insurance, covers possible financial losses related to health, travel, accidents, legal liabilities, machinery breakdown, theft, personal property, among others. These policies reimburse a predetermined amount based on the loss incurred by specific financial events, making them essential safeguards against unforeseen expenses.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">30) What is the free look period in an insurance policy? Can an insurance policyholder get the full payment on canceling the new policy in the free look period?</h3>
<p>A free look period refers to a specific time duration stated in insurance policies, during which policyholders can terminate newly bought policies without incurring any penalties or surrender charges. The duration of this period can vary from one insurance company to another, but it typically ranges from 10 to 15 days. During the free look period, policyholders are given the opportunity to evaluate the benefits and services offered by their policies and decide whether or not they want to proceed with the contract. If they are dissatisfied with any aspect of the policy, they can opt to cancel it and receive a full refund.</p>
<p>If the policyholder decides to cancel the insurance policy during the free look period, they can receive a complete refund for the premium paid.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Note: Free-look period is available only for life insurance policies.</h4>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">31) What do you understand by the term elimination period in insurance?</h3>
<p>The elimination period is a common term used in health insurance policies to describe the waiting period between the start of an injury or illness and the payment of benefits by the insurer. Essentially, it is the time period during which the insured person must wait before receiving payment. Insurance companies typically charge lower premiums for policies with longer elimination periods and higher premiums for policies with shorter elimination periods.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">32) Is it possible for a person to take two life insurance policies and claim both?</h3>
<p>It is possible for an individual to hold two separate life insurance policies and make a claim for each one.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">33) What do you understand by assessment year and previous year in the context of income tax?</h3>
<p>Income tax law defines the previous year as the year when income is earned. Conversely, the assessment year is when the income obtained is assessed. This means that income earned in a particular year is taxable in the following year, which is known as the assessment year. Therefore, the current financial year signifies the previous year as per common parlance. For instance, 2020-2021 represents the previous year, while 2021-2022 is the corresponding assessment year.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">34) Is it possible for a policyholder to limit the premium payments for a smaller amount of years than its duration?</h3>
<p>Insurance companies have different policies when it comes to premium payment duration. Some offer the option to pay premiums over three, five, seven, or ten years based on the policyholder's income. This allows the policyholder to obtain the full coverage they would have received with the regular payment scheme.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">35) What do you understand by the term "no physical exam" in the context of insurance policy?</h3>
<p>The phrase "no physical exam" is commonly found in health insurance and life insurance policies. This term is used by insurance companies to attract more customers who want to skip the mandatory physical exam. By offering this option, insurance providers allow policyholders to take out a policy without having to undergo a medical examination beforehand. However, the insurance premiums for these policies are typically more expensive than those that require a physical exam. Ultimately, the decision to choose a policy with or without a physical exam should depend on personal circumstances and priorities.</p>
