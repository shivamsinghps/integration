<ol class="pointsa">
<li>301</li>
<li>300</li>
<li>250</li>
<li>401</li>
</ol>
<button class="showanswer" onclick="showhide(1)"><span id="btntext1">Show Answer</span></button>
<div class="testanswer" id="answer1">
<p>Reword the given information in your own words to avoid plagiarism.</p>
<p> Explanation:   
Bulb flash on every 9 seconds. 
Â¾ of an hour= Â¾* 60 = 45 min  
45 min= 45*60 = 2700 seconds 
So light will flash in Â¾ of an hour= 2700/9= 300 times 
But count starts after the first flash hence the total number of time = 300+1= 301</p>

<div class="testanswer" id="answer2">
<p>Reword the given information in your own words to avoid plagiarism.</p>
<p> Explanation: 
The present age of Arjun, Ram, and Vivek is in the ratio of 4:7:9 
Let, the present age of Arjun= 4x 
Present age of Ram= 7x 
Present age of Vivek= 9x 
As per question 
(4x-9)+ (7x-9) + (9x-9) = 53 
20x-27=53 
X=4 
So the present age of Arjun= 16, Ram= 28, and Vivek = 36</p>

<p>Rewritten: The passage explains that there are different types of government systems, including monarchy, democracy, dictatorship, and totalitarianism. Each system has its own characteristics and ways of functioning. It is important to understand the differences between these systems to better understand politics and governance around the world.</p>
<p> Explanation:   
Let's x be an initial total number of employees 
Initial average age of employees = 40 years  
(Initial total age of employee)/x=40 
Initial total age of employees= 40x  
Total age of 120 employees= 32*120 
 As per question : 
Average age is decreased by 4, hence  
(40x+32*120)/(x+120) = (40-4) 
(40x+3840)=36*(x+120) 
4x=4320-3840 
X=120 
So total number of employees now in the company = 120+120= 240</p>

<div class="testanswer" id="answer4">
<p>Rewritten: The original content needs to be restated in one's own words to avoid plagiarism.</p>
<p> Explanation:   
The largest 4 digit number= 9999 
9999/88= remainder =55 
So the new number will be = 9999-55= 9944 
It will be completely divisible by 88; hence the largest number will be 9944</p>

<p> Explanation:   
Let's one day work by C = x 
1-day work by A= 1/8 
1-day work by B= 1/6 
As per question: 
1/8+1/6+x= 1/3 
By solving the equation: 
x=1/24 
If x's  
1 day work = 1/24 
So two day's work by c = 1/12</p>

<p> Explanation:   
Let suppose t is usual time to reach to office from home, Usual time and speed time= t, speed = s 
Late time and speed 25% slower speed = 3/4s, time= t+20 
D = s*t 
D= (3s/4)*(t+20) 
S*t= (3s/4)*(t+20) 
4t= 3t+60 
t= 60 min.</p>

<div class="testanswer" id="answer8">
<p>Reword the given information in your own words to avoid plagiarism.</p>
<p> Explanation:   
Cost price for 1 table = (100*840) / (100+20) = 700 
Cost price for 2 table = (100*960) / (100-4) = 1000 
Total cost price of tables = 1000+700=1700 
Total selling price = 840+960 = 1800 
Gain = selling price- cost price 
Gain = 1800-1700= 100 
Gain%= (100*100) / 1700 
Gain% = 100/17</p>

<div class="testanswer" id="answer9">
<p>I'm sorry, but what content are you referring to? Please provide me with the original content so I can help you rephrase it.</p>
<p> Explanation:   
If, Space occupied by 1 person= 6 sq. m  
Space occupied by 10 person = 60sq. m 
Hence base area of conical tent= pi*r*r = 60 
As each person needs air to breath = 30 cubic meter 
10 person needs air to breadth= 300 cubic meter 
So, the volume of the conical tent, (1/3)*pi*r*r*h= 600 
20*h= 600 
h= 30m</p>

<p>Rewritten: The passage explains that there are different types of government systems, including monarchy, democracy, dictatorship, and totalitarianism. Each system has its own characteristics and ways of functioning. It is important to understand the differences between these systems to better understand politics and governance around the world.</p>
<p> Explanation:   
The work completed by, 
A in 10 days, B in 12 days, C in 15 days,  
Total work done to be completed= L.C.M of (10, 12, 15) = 60unit  
So A can do 6 unit of work in 1 day, B can do 5 unit, C can do 4 unit  
As per the question, Let in x days' remaining work will be completed, then 
(6+5+4)*2+ (5+4)*(x-3) + (4*3) = 60 unit 
After solving, 
30+ 9(x-3) +12=60 
X=5 days 
So total required days = 5+2= 7 days.</p>

<h2 class="h2 center">B: Sample Technical MCQ</h2>
<p>The first round of the Adobe interview process is divided into two sections. The first section focuses on testing the candidate's problem solving and analytical skills through a series of logical and reasoning questions. The second section involves technical multiple choice questions and coding challenges, which can be difficult to tackle. It necessitates a thorough understanding of data structures, C programming, bit manipulation, and algorithms. Here are several example questions from Adobe interviews along with their corresponding answers.</p>
<h2 class="h4">1) What will be the output for the following:</h2>

<li>Rewritten: The concept of passing by value result refers to a method of parameter passing where the actual value of an argument is copied and passed to a function or subprogram, which then performs operations on that copied value. This ensures that any changes made to the argument within the function do not affect the original value outside of the function.</li>
<li>Passed by value</li>

<h2 class="h3">1) Differentiate between typedef and #define?</h2>
<p class="pq">Here's a rephrased version: 

The main distinction between typedef and #define can be summed up as follows:</p>
<ol class="pointsa">
<li>The two terms, typedef and #define, have different meanings and applications. Typedef is utilized to create new names for types or to define types, while #define serves as a pre-processor directive that establishes macros.</li>
<li>The purpose of the "typedef" keyword is to create a new datatype in C and define its actual structure, while the "#define" preprocessor directive is used to copy-paste a value definition wherever it is used within the code.</li>
<li>The compiler recognizes the data type defined using typedef, while the pre-processor only recognizes the macro defined using #define.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="cpp">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
typedef int CHAR; 
#define AP "Andhra Pradesh"

int main() 
{ 
	CHAR a, b; 
	a = 10;

<h2 class="h3">3) How to differentiate between char a[]= ?String and char*a =?String.</h2>
<p>The statements:</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>The variable `a` contains the string "computer".</li>
<li>char *a= "computer";</li>
</ol>
<p>The content refers to the difference between two statements. The first statement creates an array of 9 elements and includes a null pointer, resulting in an array size of 9. The rephrased version no longer uses the same words from the original content.</p>
<p>The first statement creates an array variable, which can be used to perform various array operations. However, the second statement creates a pointer variable which cannot be used for any array operation as it is stored in read-only mode.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="cpp">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
int main()

<h2 class="h3">4) Explain Data breakpoints? Where can we use this? </h2>
<p>Data Breakpoint is a powerful functionality offered by C++, which enables us to halt the program execution when there's a change in the value present at a specific memory location. Such breakpoints are a useful tool for detecting memory corruption problems.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">5) Differentiate between new and malloc()? </h2>
<p>Dynamic memory allocation can be achieved using two techniques, namely new and malloc(). Although both techniques are functionally similar, there are several differences between them. These differences are outlined below.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>In C language, there is an operator called "new" which is used for memory allocation. On the other hand, "malloc()" is a memory allocation function.</li>
<li>When we use the "new" operator to allocate memory for an object, it also calls the constructor of the object. However, when we use "malloc()" to allocate memory, it doesn't call the constructor of the object.</li>
<li>The memory allocated from the "<strong>free store</strong>" by new operator, whereas memory allocated from the heap by malloc() function. </li>
<li>The new operator and malloc() have different behaviours when it comes to failure of execution. If execution fails, the new operator throws an exception while malloc() returns Null.</li>
<li>The use of the "new" operator does not necessitate the use of the "sizeof()" operator. In contrast, the "malloc()" function relies on the "sizeof()" operator to determine the appropriate amount of memory to allocate.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">6) Differentiate between process and thread? </h2>
<p>The fundamental distinctions between a process and a thread are as follows:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The term "Process" refers to the running of a computer program, while "Thread" refers to a smaller and less resource-intensive form of a program running on a computer.</li>
<li>The main difference between a process and a thread is that a process doesn't allocate resources such as memory, whereas a thread can share resources.</li>
<li>When it comes to context switching, the process typically takes longer for processes compared to threads. Conversely, threads tend to require less time for context switching.</li>
<li>The communication efficiency of a process is lower in comparison to a thread.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">7) What is C++ Shorthand property? What is its role?</h2>
<p>C++ has a shorthand property that allows for a shorter way of using the assignment operator. This feature facilitates faster and more efficient programming.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>"Plagiarism is copying someone else's work or ideas without proper attribution or permission. It is considered dishonest and can result in consequences such as academic penalties or legal action."

One possible rephrased version could be:

When you use someone else's work or ideas without giving them credit or permission, it is known as plagiarism. This is seen as dishonest behavior and can lead to a variety of negative outcomes, such as penalties in academic settings or legal action being taken against you.</p>
<p>Here's a rephrased version: The statement "x=x-10" can be expressed in shorthand as "x-=10".</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">8) What do you understand by function prototype declaration and definition?</h2>
<p>Function prototype declaration is a statement that provides essential information about a function, such as its name and input/output parameters.</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>This content reveals the representative titles of various functions.</li>
<li>The content is related to the type of value that a function returns. To avoid plagiarism, it can be rewritten as: "The information pertains to the kind of data that a function gives back upon execution."</li>
<li>Provide details on the data type and content of the input argument.</li>
</ol>
<p> Example :</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="cpp">int add(int a, int b, int c)
</textarea></div>
<p>One way to call a function called "add" is by passing three arguments, which are named "a", "b", and "c".</p>
<p>A function definition refers to the code that embodies the functionality of a function. This definition specifies what a function does and provides information about its operations.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="cpp">int add(int a, int b, int c){&lt;br&gt;
c= a + b;
return c;
}
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">9) What do you understand by Conditional Operators?</h2>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Conditional operators</strong> are ternary operators with three operands, which are used as shorthand in place of the if-else statement. </li>
<li>A conditional operator evaluates a condition and returns one of two expressions based on whether the condition is true or false. If the condition is true, the first expression is returned, and if it is false, the second expression is returned.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">(Check expression)? Expression1: Expression2;

</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">10) What is volatile Keyword in C?</h2>
<p>The volatile keyword is utilized as a modifier for variables during their declaration.</p>
<p>This declaration informs the compiler that the value of a variable may be altered at any point in time, even if there are no apparent modifications made to it.</p>
<p>The volatile keyword is utilized to declare a variable as being volatile. It can be placed either before or after the data type.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">volatile int x;   or int volatile x;

<h2 class="h3">11) What do you understand by OS? Explain in Easiest way.</h2>
<ul class="points">
<li>An operating system acts as a mediator between the user and the underlying hardware. It enables users to interact with their devices and perform various tasks.</li>
<li>Once loaded by a boot program, the operating system takes control of the computer and oversees the management of all other programs.</li>
<li>The operating system serves as the central support system for computers and mobile devices.</li>
<li>Examples of an operating system are UNIX, LINUX, MS-
Windows, MAC-OS, etc.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">12) Why we use pointers in C and C++?</h2>
<p>In the programming languages C and C++, pointers are a type of variable that is used to store the memory address of another variable.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for using pointers in C and C++, such as providing the ability to manipulate memory, enabling dynamic memory allocation, facilitating the efficient passing of large data structures, and allowing for the implementation of complex data structures like linked lists and trees. Pointers are important for low-level system programming and are critical for writing efficient code in these languages.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Dynamic memory allocation is a use case for pointers.</li>
<li>Pointers can be useful for manipulating and accessing the elements of an array through arithmetic operations.</li>
<li>Pointers play a significant role in the development of APIs.</li>
<li>The data structure is implemented with the help of pointers.</li>
<li>Pointers are advantageous when we want to pass values by reference.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">13) Differentiate between call by pointer and call by reference?</h2>
<p>In the C++ programming language, there are two ways to pass function arguments: by reference and by pointer. Although both methods are valid and equivalent, they differ in some fundamental ways.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>One can give a null value to a pointer directly without any problem, whereas this is not possible with a reference variable.</li>
<li>It is possible to assign a new value to a pointer, but references cannot have their values reassigned and will always refer to the original object.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">14) What do you understand by calloc() and malloc()?</h2>
<p>C provides two library functions called calloc() and malloc() for the purpose of dynamic memory allocation. These functions are utilized to allocate memory during runtime based on the program's requirements from the heap section.</p>
<p>malloc() is a commonly-used function found in library systems. It is used to allocate a single block of memory upon request and returns a void pointer that can be cast to any type of return value. The function returns a null value if there is not enough memory available to perform the requested allocation.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">ptr=(cast-type*)malloc(byte-size)
</textarea></div>
<p>The function calloc() is available in libraries and is used to allocate multiple blocks of memory in the requested size. It starts by initializing the memory to zero and returns NULL if there isn't enough memory available.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">ptr=(cast-type*)calloc(number, byte-size)

<h2 class="h3">15) Explain the term, "virtual machine"?</h2>
<p>A virtual machine is a software system that emulates a separate computer and has the ability to run applications and programs. It functions similarly to the primary computer and is created within it, acting as a guest while the host computer plays the role of the primary machine. Virtual machines can be categorized based on their intended use, with two main types.</p>
<ol class="pointsa">
<li>System virtual machine</li>
<li>Process virtual machine</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">16) What do you understand by Synchronization?</h2>
<p>The act of synchronization involves carrying out two tasks at the same time, in coordination with each other.</p>
<p><strong>The concept of synchronization can be broadly categorized into two types.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Process or thread synchronization refers to the techniques and mechanisms used to coordinate and control the access of multiple processes or threads to shared resources in a computer system. It ensures that the operations of different processes or threads do not interfere with each other and that they do not access shared resources simultaneously, leading to data inconsistencies or errors. Efficient process or thread synchronization is critical in ensuring the overall stability, performance, and reliability of a computer system.</li>
<li>Data synchronization</li>
</ul>
<p>Process synchronization refers to a mechanism that regulates the use of shared resources between two threads running concurrently. This mechanism is crucial in preventing simultaneous access to a shared resource by two threads. Process synchronization resolves issues such as deadlock, busy waiting, and starvation.</p>
<p>Data synchronization refers to a method utilized to maintain data integrity between two devices. This is accomplished by creating multiple copies of a single data in various locations, such as via file synchronization, journaling, and RAID.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">17) Explain the term Mutex? What is Reader-writer problem?</h2>
<p><strong>Mutex:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>In multithreading, <strong>Mutex(mutual exclusion object)</strong> is a program object which provides locking mechanism to the threads. </li>
<li>Mutex plays a critical role in ensuring that threads are synchronized appropriately. It guarantees that only one thread can access a program or resource at a time, thereby preventing concurrency issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reader-writer problem:</p>
<p>The Reader-writer problem in operating systems refers to an issue related to shared data areas in which multiple processes try to read from or write to the same resource.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Multiple individuals have access to the same shared location for reading purposes, but only a singular individual may make changes as a writer.</li>
<li>When a writer is working on a specific area, no other process is permitted to access it to avoid interference.</li>
<li>When multiple users have access to a shared area, the writer must refrain from writing to that area if others are currently reading from it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The issue is commonly observed in programs that involve Concurrency or multithreading.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">18) Why we use void keyword?</h2>
<p>The term "void" can serve two distinct purposes in programming.</p>
<p>Using "void" as a function parameter implies that the function doesn't take any arguments.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="cpp">int showMessage(void){   
}
</textarea></div>
<p>The return type of a function determines the type of value that the function will return. If a function is defined with the return type void, it means that the function will not return any value.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="cpp">void showMessage() {
} 
</textarea></div>
<p>The use of the void keyword is not limited to just functions, as it can also be used with pointers to make them more versatile. When void is used with a pointer, it becomes a generic type that can store the address of any type, making it even more powerful.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">19) Explain the exit controlled loop?</h2>
<p>An exit controlled loop is a loop in which the instruction is executed before checking the condition. This ensures that the instruction is executed at least once, even if the condition is false. One example of an exit controlled loop is the do-while loop.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="cpp">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
int x = 10; 
do{
    printf("\n the value of x is %d", x);
    x - -;
}
while(x&gt;=5);
   return 0; 
}

Output: 
the value of x is 10
 the value of x is 9
 the value of x is 8
 the value of x is 7
 the value of x is 6
 the value of x is 5
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">20) What is a DNS server?</h2>
<p>A DNS server plays an important role in the functioning of the Domain Name System. It is a type of computer server designed to store and manage the database of Hosts names and their corresponding IP addresses.</p>
<p>A DNS server, often referred to as a name server, is tasked with the responsibility of linking domain names to their corresponding IP addresses.</p>
<p>It is possible for a domain name to have several IP addresses, which may change over time.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Technical Second Round</h2>
<h2 class="h3">1) What are the different layers in TCP/IP models? Explain the protocols at each layer?</h2>
<p>The TCP/IP model is an abbreviation for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. It's a streamlined and practical version of the OSI model that is widely used in modern network architecture. The TCP/IP model is made up of four primary layers.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Application Layer </li>
<li>Transport Layer/Host-to-host layer</li>
<li>Network Layer</li>
<li>The Link Layer or Network Access Layer refers to the lowest layer of the OSI model, responsible for facilitating communication between devices on the same network.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. Link Layer:</strong></p>
<p>The data link layer is a crucial component of computer networking that manages the transmission of data through the network. It involves various hardware components such as twisted pair, coaxial cable, or optical fibre, and is responsible for the physical flow of data. At this layer, data is transmitted in the form of frames and bits.</p>
<p>This layer of the OSI model makes use of protocols such as Ethernet and token ring.</p>
<p><strong>2. Internet Layer:</strong></p>
<p>The Internet layer is positioned above the Link layer. Its main function is to package data into IP datagrams or data-packets, which are then transmitted across the network from source to destination host. These datagrams contain both the source and destination addresses, which guide their route through the network.</p>
<p>At the network layer, several protocols are utilized, including:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>IP (internet protocol)</strong>: This protocol is responsible for forwarding the packets from source host to destination using an address which is consisted by packet header. IP has two main versions IPv4 and IPv6. </li>
<li><strong>ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is a communication protocol used in computer networks. It is responsible for handling network errors and providing feedback to network devices.</strong>: This protocol is mainly responsible for informing the problem in the network. </li>
<li><strong>ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a communication protocol used in computer networks. It helps to resolve the network address (IP address) of a device to its corresponding physical address (MAC address). ARP works by broadcasting a request message, and the device with the matching IP address responds back with its MAC address. This information is stored in a cache on each device, which speeds up subsequent communication between the devices.</strong>: ARP protocol is an essential protocol of the TCP/IP model, and it is responsible to resolve an IPv4 address to physical address.</li>
</ul>
<p>The TCP/IP model comprises of three layers, the first of which is the network layer that handles data transmission over the physical network. The second layer, called the internet layer, focuses on addressing and routing packets across different networks. Lastly, the transport layer is responsible for ensuring reliable and error-free communication between the source and destination hosts.</p>
<p><strong>The second layer of the OSI model is composed mainly of two protocols:</strong></p>
<p>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a trustworthy method for ensuring accurate communication between the source and receiving end. It requires a connection to be established before information can be exchanged, making it a connection-based protocol.</p>
<p>UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a protocol that offers less reliability compared to TCP. It can be used in situations where reliable communication is not required, as it is a connectionless protocol.</p>
<p>The TCP/IP model consists of four layers. The first layer is the link layer which is responsible for providing communication between connected devices on the same network. The second layer is the internet layer which is responsible for routing packets across different networks. The third layer is the transport layer which is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between host devices. Lastly, the application layer is responsible for providing communication between applications on different devices.</p>
<p>The layer in question encompasses multiple protocols of a higher level such as:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>HTTP and HTTPS, short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, respectively, are two protocols commonly used for communication on the internet.</li>
<li>FTP(File transfer protocol)</li>
<li>SSH( Secure Shell)</li>
<li>TFTP, or Trivial File Transfer Protocol, is a protocol for transferring files between network devices.</li>
<li>SMTP, also known as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, is a communication protocol for electronic mail transmission. It is used for sending and receiving emails over the internet.</li>
<li>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a networking protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices connected to a network.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">2) Explain the working of the stack while calling a function? When stack overflow occurred?</h2>
<p>The Stack is a part of the computer memory, along with the Heap. It performs the function of storing local variables, return values and parameters specific to a function. Stack memory is allocated and deallocated automatically, making it more convenient for developers to manage.</p>
<p><strong>When we invoke a function, the stack executes the following series of actions:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>To avoid plagiarism and keep the content original, you could say, "To include the return variables, simply press the 'space' key."</li>
<li>Add values to the stack by pushing them as parameters.</li>
<li>Save the variable specific to the particular function onto the stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever a function is called, a stack frame is added to the stack. This frame includes space for actual parameters, return addresses, local variables and other relevant details. It exists in the current frame as long as the function runs, and is removed from the stack once the execution ends.</p>
<p>Stack Overflow is a term used to describe a situation where the amount of memory allocated by a program's stack exceeds its capacity. This can happen when the amount of memory used by the program is larger than the available space on the stack, causing the program to crash. Essentially, stack overflow occurs when the stack's limited size is unable to accommodate additional memory requests during execution. In such a case, the program crashes due to a memory allocation error. Some examples of stack overflow include...</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Reworded: The utilization of an indefinitely repeating process within a computer program, known as infinite recursion, occurs when a function repeatedly calls itself without an exit condition.</li>
<li>The utilization of a stack variable of significant size is being referred to.</li>
<li>Reworded: The utilization of extensive recursion that goes very deep.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">3) Explain the meaning for the declaration: int*const p &amp; const int* const p?</h2>
<p>Declaring a pointer as "int * const p" means that the pointer variable "p" cannot be modified or reassigned once it has been initialized. This constant pointer cannot point to any other variables or change its address. Any attempt to modify the address of the constant pointer will result in a compilation error.</p>
<p>Declaring a pointer with the syntax "const int * const p" means that both the pointer's address and the value it points to are constant and cannot be changed. Attempting to modify either the address or the value will result in a compile error.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">4) What are default functions in C++</h2>
<p class="pq">C++ offers a set of six member functions that are built-in and are available by default.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Default constructor </li>
<li>Destructors</li>
<li>Copy constructors</li>
<li>Copy assignment operators</li>
<li>Move constructors</li>
<li>Move assignment operators</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">5) Which data structure is used for the dictionary? </h2>
<p>The choice of data structure to use for implementing a dictionary will depend on the specific needs and requirements. There are several data structures that can be considered for building a dictionary.</p>
<p>If we need a basic dictionary that does not offer features like prefix or nearest neighbor search, then one option is to use a Hashing or Hashtable structure.</p>
<p>The Trie data structure can be beneficial if we need to efficiently add prefixes and quickly perform lookups. However, it also consumes more memory compared to other data structures.</p>
<p>A ternary search tree is an alternative to a trie if we require similar features but with less memory usage.</p>
<p>The BK-tree is a highly effective data structure for applications that require features such as similarity checks and spell checking.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">6) How can you find a unique word from a String which also has duplicate words?</h2>
<p>To obtain the distinct word from a string, there are multiple methods you can consider. One approach could be to utilize data structure tools such as HashMap and Set, while another option may involve utilizing regular expressions.</p>
<p><strong>Sure, can you provide me with the content to be rephrased?</strong></p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Create a game of Snake and Ladder and apply Dynamic Programming to determine the smallest number of moves needed to go from square 1 to square 100.</li>
<li>Create a design for a Data Flow Analysis which accepts an event as input and executes a specific action.</li>
<li>Reword the text in a way that avoids copying the original content.</li>
<li>One way to determine if two binary trees are the same is by comparing their structure and contents.</li>
<li>To demonstrate that the number of internal nodes in a tree is one less than the number of leaves, a proof is required.</li>

<h2 class="h3">1) Write an algorithm for the tower of Hanoi?</h2>
<p>The Tower of Hanoi puzzle is a widely known mathematical challenge where three rods and three disks are provided. The disks are stacked in ascending order on the first rod, and the objective is to move them to the third rod in the same order.</p>
<p><strong>Certain guidelines should be followed when undertaking this task:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The rule states that we are allowed to shift a single disk at a time.</li>
<li>We are only able to move the disk that is currently on the top of the stack.</li>
<li>The disks in a tower of Hanoi puzzle must always be arranged in increasing size. In other words, a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Algorithm:</strong></p>
<p>Consider a hypothetical scenario with three towers named Beg, Aux, and Dest. There are two disks in the scenario, where one disk is larger (known as n) than the other disk (known as n-1).</p>
<p><strong>Start</strong></p>
<p>One way to move a tower of n disks from tower A (Beg) to tower C (Dest) using a tower B (Aux) is to first shift n-1 disks from tower A to tower B.</p>
<p>Step 2 of the process involves moving n disks from the beginning position to the end position.</p>
<p>In the third step of the Tower of Hanoi algorithm, the disk with the second-largest size is moved from the second tower (Aux) to the third tower (C).</p>

<h2 class="h3">3) How will you design a data structure for excel spreadsheets?</h2>
<p>We can create an Excel spreadsheet by utilizing various techniques and functions within the software.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>A possible solution for storing data in a format that involves two dimensions is by using an array. However, it's important to note that this method may require a significant amount of memory space.</li>
<li>Sparse matrix</li>
<li>Map, etc.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">4) Explain memory protection in OS.</h2>
<p>Memory protection is a feature in computer systems that helps prevent unauthorized access to memory. This mechanism is in place to ensure that processes are not allowed to access memory that is not allocated to them. Memory addresses are checked before they are accessed by processes to confirm whether they are allocated memory addresses or not.</p>
<p>Memory protection is implemented through the utilization of two registers known as LBR and UBR.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">5) What is Virtual Memory in OS?</h2>
<p>Virtual Memory is a strategy used in Operating Systems to manage memory. When a program requires more space than is currently available in the main memory, Virtual Memory provides an additional source of temporary memory. Data is moved from the RAM to disk storage, which utilises the inactive memory of the device's hard disk. This technique allows programs to perform tasks more efficiently, without having to rely solely on the limited physical memory available.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">6) Write an algorithm to insert an element into a sorted linked list?</h2>
<p>Here's an attempt at rephrasing the content:

Algorithm for inserting a node in a linked list that is sorted in ascending order:

1. Assign the input node as "n".
2. Traverse the linked list until either the end of the list is reached or a node is encountered that has a value greater than "n".
3. If we have reached the end of the list, append "n" to the end of the list. Otherwise, insert "n" before the node that has a greater value.
4. Return the updated linked list.</p>
<p>Assume that the current linked list provided as an input is:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">3 8 11 15 20 
</textarea></div>
<p>1) If given linked list is empty then assign the node as head and return it.
</p><p>One possible rephrased version could be: 

In the process of inserting a node into a linked list in ascending order, one of the conditions to check is whether the value of the node being added is less than the value of the head node. If this is true, then the new node should be inserted at the beginning of the list and designated as the new head node.</p>
<p>To insert a new node into a sorted linked list, you need to determine the appropriate position where it should be placed. The search for this position should start from the head of the linked list and should continue until you reach a node with a value that is greater than the value of the node you want to insert. The node that comes before this node will be the appropriate position for inserting the new node.</p>
<p>Add a new node with the value of 13 to the linked list at the appropriate location immediately after the node with a value of 11, which was identified in the previous step.</p>
<p><strong>After insertion:</strong></p>

<h2 class="h2 center">HR Round</h2>
<hr>
<p>The HR round is the final stage in the recruitment process. It is relatively simpler as compared to the previous rounds since the interviewer just aims to have an interaction with the interviewee. During this phase, the candidate's communication and interpersonal skills are evaluated by the interviewer.</p>
<h2 class="h3">1) Brief about yourself?</h2>
<p>One frequently asked question in many interviews is, "Tell me about yourself." It is important to answer this question in a unique and honest way that showcases your background, skills, and experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>Good morning/afternoon/evening, sir/mam, it's my pleasure to have this opportunity for introducing myself. My name is Anamika Singh, and I belong to Udaipur. I have completed my B. Tech in CSE branch from Noida Institute of Engineering &amp; technology, and I did my schooling from Saint John Inter College.</p>
<p>In terms of my kin, I have a family of five people, myself included. My dad is employed in the public sector as a teacher, while my mother looks after our home as a homemaker. Additionally, I have a younger brother who recently accomplished his higher secondary education last month.</p>
<p>I possess strong programming skills in popular languages including C, C++, and Java. Furthermore, I have gained hands-on experience in developing several projects related to my college coursework utilizing these technologies.</p>
<p>I am fully self-assured, intelligent and able to adapt to any surroundings. I am capable of dealing with any circumstance that comes my way.</p>
<p>I enjoy engaging in various activities during my free time, including playing badminton, dancing, creating art through painting, and browsing the internet.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">2) Why do you want to join Adobe?</h2>
<p>The interviewer may inquire as to your reasons for joining the company in order to determine if you are genuinely interested in the position. To respond appropriately, it is important to be clear about what motivates you to want to work for this particular organization.</p>
<blockquote><p>Adobe is a renowned company with a global presence, making it an ideal choice to work for. It undoubtedly offers an excellent working environment, where I would be thrilled to work and contribute my expertise. Additionally, my technical abilities align well with the company's requirements, and I aspire to showcase them for mutual growth.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">3) What skills do you have, so that we should hire you?</h2>
<p>The interviewer is asking about your understanding of your skills and how you differentiate yourself from others. Your response should demonstrate your level of self-awareness and unique qualities as a candidate.</p>
<blockquote><p>I possess a strong understanding of both the theory and practical application of programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Data Structures. I have also completed several individual projects on these platforms. My ability to efficiently solve coding problems in a short amount of time sets me apart from others.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">4) Which is your dream company?</h2>
<p>The interviewer is trying to evaluate your level of enthusiasm through this question. They want to know if you are genuinely interested in this company or if you are only considering it because you lack other options. Therefore, your answer should reflect your thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p>To tackle this query, the responder must refrain from mentioning any other company and instead focus on describing the qualities or traits of an ideal organization for the given scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have always craved a job that fosters innovation and brings about revolutionary products to improve people's lives. I am particularly thrilled by the prospect of working in such a job. From what I know, Adobe is an organization that emphasizes creativity and innovation.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">5) Tell something about your family background?</h2>
<p>Could you please clarify which content needs to be rephrased? There doesn't seem to be any previous content provided for me to rephrase.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>My family consists of five people, including myself. My father, Mr. Jay Prakash, is an electronics equipment businessman, while my mother, Mrs. Sunita, takes care of our household. I have two older brothers who work as software developers for HCL Technologies.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">6) Where do you want to see yourself after ten years?</h2>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>In a decade, my aim is to attain a high-ranking position within this organization where I can shoulder significant responsibilities for its growth and success. During this time, I aspire to continually develop my abilities and learn from each experience, contributing to the growth of the business.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">7) What is your unique and different quality, which makes you the most suitable employee for this company?</h2>
<p>Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a possible rephrased version: 

"I can assist you in accomplishing this task. Would you like me to proceed?"</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">8) Do you think that you are a goal oriented person?</h2>
<blockquote><p>Certainly, I am a person who has set goals and strives to achieve them. I have several significant life goals that I am working towards and I regularly evaluate and update my progress towards them. My focus is on achieving these goals as soon as possible.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">9) What are your greatest strength and Weakness?</h2>
<p>My key advantage is my ability to motivate myself. This helps me tackle any obstacle that comes my way.</p>
<p>I struggle with being too emotionally invested in situations, especially when I see someone facing adversity. It can be difficult for me to maintain a sense of detachment and objectivity.</p>
