<div class="testanswer" id="answer12">
<p>Reword the text in a manner that does not copy the original source.</p>
<p> Explanation:   
Total cost price of 40 shirts including transportation = 3000+ (3000*10)/100 = 3300 
Given profit = 20% 
Hence, Selling price = (100+20)*3300/100 
S.P of 40 shirts = 3960 
So S.P. of 1 shirt = 3960/40= Rs.99</p>

<p>Reword the text in a manner that does not copy the original source.</p>
<p> Explanation:   
Suppose man's usual speed = s, and usual time = t  
So distance = speed *time ==&gt; d= s*t 
If he travels with 5/6th of his usual speed which is = s*5/6 
And time= (t+15) and distance, d = (s*5/6)*(t+15) {as distance will be same}  
s*t = (s*5/6)*(t+15)  
t= (5t+75)/6 
t= 75 min.</p>

Cost price of bed= Rs.2400 
Let's take market price of bed = X 
As the question

C.P= 80*X/100 -&gt; 2400=8*X/10 
X = Rs.3000.  
-&gt; S.P = 3000 ? (16*3000)/100 
Selling Price = 2520

<p>Rewrite the given text in your own words to avoid plagiarism.</p>
<p> Explanation:   
(A+B)'s 1-day work, when working together= 1/30 
(A+B)'s 20 days' work= 20/30==&gt; 2/3  
Remaining work = (1-2/3) ===&gt; 1/3 
Remaining work was done by A in 20 more days = 1/3 
So A can complete the whole work alone in = 20* 3 ===&gt;60 days  
Hence A's 1-day work, working alone = 1/60 
B?s 1 day work, working alone = 1/30-1/60======1/60  
So B will take 60 days to for completing the entire word.

<h2 class="h3">1) Differentiate between low-level language and high-level language?</h2>
<p>Since computers cannot comprehend human language, we require a distinct language to interact with them. Computer languages vary, with some being comprehensible to computers and dictating their actions. Therefore, two types of languages exist.</p>
<p><strong>Low-level language and high-level language are two different programming languages used in computer programming. They have distinct differences in terms of complexity and ease of use.</strong></p>
<p>Below are the major distinctions between the two languages:</p>
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Low-level language</th>
<th>High-level language</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Low-level languages are programming languages that are designed for a specific computer architecture, making them machine-dependent. They cannot be executed on different platforms.</td>
<td>High-level programming languages are designed to be used on any platform, regardless of whether it's a Mac, Windows, or Linux operating system. These languages are written in a way that does not depend on the specific architecture or hardware of the machine. This makes it easier for developers to create software that can be used on multiple platforms without having to rewrite the code for each one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Languages that are considered low-level are designed to be easily understandable by machines.</td>
<td>High-level programming languages are designed to be easily understandable by humans. Unlike low-level languages which are closer to machine language and more difficult for humans to read and understand, high-level languages use familiar words and syntax that are easier to comprehend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Creating and assembling a low-level language can be a challenging task.</td>
<td>Compared to low-level languages, high-level languages are simpler and faster to write and compile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Debugging programs written in low-level languages can be a challenging task as it can be hard to identify errors within the code.</td>
<td>It is simple to identify a mistake and fix it in a high-level coding language.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Low-level languages are coded in binary machine language, resulting in faster program execution compared to high-level programming languages that use human-readable syntax.</td>
<td>Programming languages that are designed to be easily readable and understandable by humans, such as high-level languages, require a conversion process into binary form before they can be executed by a computer. This conversion process can cause high-level languages to be slower compared to lower-level languages.</td>

<h2 class="h3">2) Explain an interface in Java language?</h2>
<p>Java interface is a technique for achieving abstraction in programming. Similar to classes, interfaces can have variables and methods, but only in the form of a signature without a body.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>It is not possible to create an instance of an Interface in Java.</li>
<li>An Interface consists of methods that are by default public and abstract.</li>
<li>One possible rephrased version could be: "It is possible for a class to embody or satisfy the requirements specified by an interface through implementation."</li>
<li>To create an interface in programming, we utilize the keyword "interface".</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">Interface Interface_Name{
//Methods
}
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">3) How can we create an interface in Java?</h2>
<p>One way to define an interface in Java is by using the keyword "interface" followed by the interface name.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">interface Employee { 
int empid = 23;
String empname="John";
}
</textarea></div>
<p>To incorporate an interface in a class and make use of abstract methods, we can use the "implement" keyword.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">4) What is immutable class and how to create an immutable class in Java?</h2>
<p>An immutable class is a type of class that is completely unalterable once an object is created. This means that all values and contents attached to the object cannot be changed. Common examples of immutable classes in Java are the wrapper classes like Integer, Boolean, and String. Additionally, it is possible to create custom immutable classes.</p>
<p>Here are some guidelines to ensure that a class in Java is immutable:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>One may declare a class as final to prevent it from being inherited by other classes.</li>
<li>It is necessary to declare all data members in a class as final to ensure that their values cannot be modified.</li>
<li>There is no provision available for setters method to modify the values of specific data fields.</li>
<li>It is recommended to provide getter methods for all variables in a program or class. This is because getter methods can help to access and retrieve the values of these variables, which can be useful for performing certain operations or calculations. By including getter methods, the overall functionality and usability of the program or class can be improved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">5) "String class is immutable", explain the reason?</h2>
<p>In Java, the String class is considered immutable, which indicates that we cannot modify its value. This is due to the fact that String objects are always cached in a shared pool and can be utilized by different clients. Therefore, modifying a string value for one client could potentially affect all other clients. As a result, every time we attempt to modify a string's value, a new object must be created.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">6) How can we inherit the constructor in a class, in Java?</h2>
<p>It is not possible to inherit a constructor in a class. Attempting to inherit a parent class constructor to a child class results in a compile-time error since the constructor name should match the class name and constructor inheritance goes against the constraints of constructors.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="html">class ConstructInheritance{
    
    ConstructInheritance()
    {
    System.out.println("This is Parent class Constructor");
    }
}

class Child extends ConstructInheritance{
 
     Child()
     {
    System.out.println("This is Child  class Constructor"); 
}       
   public static void main (String[] args) {
    Child obj= new Child();
    Child obj2=new ConstructInheritance();
}  }
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>Error message:
prog.java:10: error: invalid method declaration; return type required
   ConstructInheritance(){
</pre></div>
<h4 class="n">Note: Although we can call parent class constructor in child class using super() method in a child class</h4>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">7) What is a static keyword in Java? What is its significance?</h2>
<p>In Java programming, the static keyword serves as a way to manage memory. When a member of a Java class is declared as static, it belongs to the class itself rather than any instances of the class. This means that static can be used to organize and maintain data within a class. It's important to note that the static keyword can be applied to different types of members within a class.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Blocks </li>
<li>Variables </li>
<li>Methods</li>
<li>Nested class</li>
</ul>
<p>When creating a static member, it's necessary to declare it as static. This type of member is only instantiated once and is shared by all objects. Furthermore, it's possible to access a static member prior to an object being created.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class Employee   {
    
  static int i;             //static variable
    
    static void m1()     //Static method
    {
     System.out.println("This is static mehtod ");   
    }
    
    static                         //static block
    {
        for(i=1; i&lt;=5; i++){
  
        System.out.println("the value of i in static block=" +i);}
    }
   public static void main (String[] args) {
    m1();
    }
}
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock3"><pre>the value of i in static block=1
the value of i in static block=2
the value of i in static block=3
the value of i in static block=4
the value of i in static block=5
This is static mehtod 
</pre></div>

<h2 class="h3">8) What do you understand by Encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction in JAVA?</h2>
<p>Object-oriented programming has three key features: encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction. These features allow developers to interact with objects in a structured way.</p>
<p>Encapsulation is a crucial aspect of Object-Oriented Programming. It involves combining the data and methods in a cohesive unit. This way, the data is protected from external access and manipulation, ensuring its integrity and security.</p>
<p>Encapsulation is a technique that allows us to keep the data members of a class hidden from other classes. This means that the data can only be accessed by the class in which it is defined.</p>
<p>Encapsulation can be achieved through two different approaches.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Change the access modifier of the class variable to private.</li>
<li>One way to assign and retrieve values is by utilizing public Setter and Getter methods. This involves creating methods that can set values to a variable and return values from it, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>Java's inheritance feature allows a class to inherit properties, such as methods and fields, from another class. This feature enhances the reusability of code and facilitates the use of inherited methods while also allowing for the addition of new methods. Inheriting properties creates a parent-child relationship and is commonly referred to as an IS-A relationship.</p>
<p>The concept of inheritance in programming involves various terms such as superclass, subclass, inheritance hierarchy, polymorphism, and encapsulation.</p>
<p>A child class or subclass is a type of class that obtains its features and characteristics from another class, which is known as the parent or superclass. In other words, the child class inherits the properties and behaviors of the parent class.</p>
<p>A Superclass or Parent class is a base class that can be inherited by another class. In Java, the 'extends' keyword is used to inherit one class into another.</p>
<p>Here's a rephrased version: 

One way to use inheritance in programming is to create a subclass that inherits properties and methods from its parent class. This allows for code reuse and can make development more efficient. The syntax for declaring a subclass that inherits from a parent class typically involves using the "extends" keyword.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class A extends B 
{  
   //methods and fields  
}  
</textarea></div>
<p>Suppose there are two classes, namely A and B. Here, class B is the Parent class, and class A is the child class.</p>
<p>In object-oriented programming (OOP), there is a key principle called abstraction. This principle allows users to display only the necessary functionalities of an object without exposing the intricate details of its implementation. Java language supports two ways of achieving abstraction.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>One possible rephrased version is: Utilizing an abstract class with a range of 0 to 100% can be a viable option.</strong>: A class which is declared using 'abstract' keyword is considered as an abstract class. An abstract class can have an abstract method as well as non-abstract methods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">abstract class A{  }
</textarea></div>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>The content will need to be provided first before I can rephrase it to ensure that it's not plagiarized.</strong>: An interface in Java is the same as a class in java, it can have abstract methods and variables. But it cannot have a method body. we can declare it by using the interface keyword</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">Interface Interface_Name{
//Methods    }
</textarea></div>

<h2 class="h3">9) What is Normalization? Explain its types?</h2>
<p>Normalization is a process used to design and manage databases efficiently. Its primary goal is to meet two fundamental requirements:</p>
<ol class="pointsa">
<li>Reducing the amount of redundant data.</li>
<li>Logical data integrity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Normalizing a database improves its efficiency by reducing the amount of memory it takes up. This leads to better database performance and faster data retrieval.</p>
<p>There exist primarily four categories of normalization.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/igate-interview-questions-q9.png" alt="IGATE Interview Questions">
<ul class="points">
<li>First normal form (1NF) requires that a table's attributes must contain only single values. A relation is considered to be in 1NF if each attribute within the table meets this requirement.</li>
<li>2NF: </li>
<li>3NF</li>
<li>BCNF</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">10) Can we check whether a link list is circular or not?</h2>
<p>It is possible to determine if a linked list is circular or not. A linked list is considered circular if it meets certain criteria, which include:</p>
<ol class="pointsa">
<li>If a link list is not terminated with a null pointer (it points to the first node), then...</li>
<li>In a scenario where all the nodes are interconnected in a cyclical pattern.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">11) What does itoa() function in C?</h2>
<p>The itoa() function is a C language function that can be utilized to convert an integer value into a corresponding null-terminated string. This function is capable of storing the outcome in an array.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">char *  itoa ( int value, char * str, int base );
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>
<p>Rewritten: The input or data that requires a transformation from one form to another is referred to as a source, and the resulting output or data after the conversion process is referred to as the target. Meanwhile, the value is the specific piece of information that needs to undergo the conversion process.</p>
<p>Rewritten: The str parameter is utilized to hold the converted value in the form of an array.</p>
<p>A "base" is a numerical value that serves as the foundation for a conversion system. For example, the base can be set as 2 for binary or 10 for decimal.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">12) How can determine the size of the class?</h2>
<p>The size of a class is influenced by its constituent elements. Several factors contribute to determining the size of a class:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The total size occupied by all the non-static members of a class.</li>
<li>Rewritten: If the class has a parent class, its size should also be taken into consideration.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">13) What do you understand by aggregation? How it differs with the association?</h2>
<p>In the Unified Modeling Language (UML), object-oriented systems have different types of relationships. Two of these are Association and Aggregation.</p>
<p>Aggregation refers to a type of association between several objects, where the objects can have their lifespan with ownership. Unlike other types of relationships, it is unidirectional, meaning that destroying one object does not affect the other. This type of relationship is also known as a "HAS-A" relationship.</p>
<p>Association refers to a connection between two entities that exist independently and without any ownership. This relationship does not involve any form of control or responsibility. Such a relationship can be portrayed using the following category:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>One-to-one</li>
<li>One-to-many</li>
<li>Many-to-many</li>
</ul>
<p>Aggregation and composition are components of the association concept in object-oriented programming.</p>

<h2 class="h3">15) What do you understand by pre-processor? What are different types of header files in C?</h2>
<p>The C pre-processor is a tool that scans and alters source code prior to its compilation. Pre-processor directives, marked by a '#' symbol and a directive name in the source code, are used to invoke the pre-processor to process code before it is compiled.</p>
<ol class="pointsa">
<li>It is not possible to have multiple pre-processor directives in a single code line.</li>
<li>Here's a rephrased version: 

Pre-processor commands must not be terminated by a semicolon.</li>
</ol>
<p>Header files are a crucial aspect of C programming language. They contain various definitions and function calls required for execution. Generally, header files are indicated with a file extension of ".h" and used with pre-processor directives. There are two kinds of header files utilized in C programming.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The header files that are included with the compiler are known as system header files.</li>
<li>Custom header files are authored by the developer.</li>

<h2 class="h3">18) What type of operation can be performed using stack and queue in Data structure?</h2>
<p>Data organization in computers is a crucial aspect that enables data to be accessed efficiently. One type of data structure used for this purpose is known as "Stack" and another is called "Queue". These two structures facilitate efficient data management in a computer system.</p>
<p>A stack is a linear data structure that organizes data in a stacked form. It functions similarly to a physical stack of plates where items can only be added or removed from the top. As a result, any operation on the data in a stack can only be performed at one end.</p>
<p>A Stack is a type of structure used to operate on data items in a particular order, with options that include LIFO (Last in First Out) or FILO (First in Last Out). Arrays can be used to represent a stack.</p>
<p>The following are the different procedures that can be carried out on a stack:</p>
<p>"Push" is a function within the stack data structure that enables the addition of an element to the stack.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/igate-interview-questions-q18.png" alt="IGATE Interview Questions">
<p>The diagram indicates that the highest element in the stack had a value of 93 before a new element was added. Once the PUSH operation was performed, the top element became 10, and the pointer shifted to indicate the new top of the stack.</p>
<p>Pop operation refers to the action of taking out or deleting an element from a Stack.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/igate-interview-questions-q18_2.png" alt="IGATE Interview Questions">
<p>The given image depicts the removal of an element from the top of a Stack using the Pop operation. This operation allows us to delete the element from the topmost position of the Stack.</p>
<p>The isEmpty operation is used to determine whether a stack is empty or not. It returns a value indicating whether the stack is empty or not. If a Pop operation is attempted on an empty stack, this is known as an underflow condition.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/igate-interview-questions-q18_3.png" alt="IGATE Interview Questions">
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr>
<td>Empty</td>
<td>-1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Single element present</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stack is full</td>
<td>N-1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stack overflow</td>
<td>N</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Here's an attempt to rephrase the content:

The fourth operation that can be performed on a stack is Peek or Top. When we use the Peek operation, it examines every element that's in the stack and then gives us back the element that is currently at the top of the stack.</p>
<p>A Queue is a sequence of data elements that is organized in a specific order, similar to a stack. However, it differs in that it allows for the insertion of elements at one end, known as the REAR end, and the removal of elements from the other end, referred to as the FRONT end.</p>
<p>A Queue is a type of data structure that operates on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. This means that the order in which data elements are inserted into and removed from the queue is determined by the order in which they were added.</p>
<p>One possible rephrased version could be: 

A common example of a queue is when people form a line to purchase a movie ticket, waiting patiently for their turn to approach the ticket counter.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/igate-interview-questions-q18_4.png" alt="IGATE Interview Questions">
<p>There are two primary operations that are performed on a stack.</p>
<p>There are two main operations in the Stack data structure: Enqueue and Dequeue.</p>
<p> Enqueue :</p>
<p>Enqueue operation is utilized to insert an item at the rear end of a queue. This operation updates the Rear pointer count by one after an item is added to the queue. An array can also be used to represent a queue while implementing the Enqueue operation.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/igate-interview-questions-q18_5.png" alt="IGATE Interview Questions"> <img src="/Assets/interview/images/igate-interview-questions-q18_6.png" alt="IGATE Interview Questions">
<br>
<p><strong>Dequeue:</strong></p>
<p>This function is used to eliminate an element from the front end of the queue. The Front pointer's count is then reduced by 1. The diagram below demonstrates the process of removing a data element from the queue.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/igate-interview-questions-q18_7.png" alt="IGATE Interview Questions">
<p>Below are some examples of operations that can be performed on a queue:</p>
<p>The "peek" operation is a method of accessing all of the data elements in a queue without actually removing them from the front end.</p>
<p>The operation of Isfull checks the capacity of a queue to determine if it is capable of storing additional elements or not.</p>
<p>The "isempty" operation is utilized to verify if a queue is empty or not.</p>

<h2 class="h3">23) What are searching techniques? Explain the linear search?</h2>
<p>The act of finding the location or value of a data element within a given list is known as searching. A search method is considered successful if it locates the data element, otherwise it is considered unsuccessful. The two main types of commonly used searching techniques are:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Linear Search, also known as Sequential Search, is an algorithm for finding an element within a list or an array by sequentially checking every element within the list until the desired element is found.</li>
<li>Binary Search</li>
</ul>
<p>Linear search is a simple method for finding an element in a list, whether it's sorted or unsorted. This method is commonly used on arrays. With linear search, we sequentially check each element in the list until the desired element is found or until the end of the list is reached. To better understand how linear search works, let's consider the example of an array with eight elements.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">Input:  a [ ] = {10, 140, 589, 20, 89, 78, 90, 110}
     x= 90;
 Output: 6. 
</textarea></div>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/igate-interview-questions-q23.png" alt="IGATE Interview Questions">
<p>Linear search is a common algorithm used to find the presence of a certain element in a list or array of elements. It works by sequentially checking each element until a match is found or the end of the list is reached. In simple terms, it scans through each element until it finds the element of interest or confirm its absence.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>One possible way to complete this task is by iterating over the array list.</li>
<li>Reword the text so that it does not contain any copied phrases or sentences from the original source.</li>
<li>The third step in searching for an element in an array list is to check if the key element exists in the list. If it is found, the function should return the index position of the element in the array list.</li>
<li>Rewritten: After iterating through the array and not finding the key element, the function should return -1.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>One way to implement linear search using Java programming language involves searching through an array of elements one by one until a match is found or the end of the array is reached. This can be accomplished by iterating over each element of the array and comparing it with the target value. If a match is found, the index of the element is returned. If the end of the array is reached and no match is found, a special value (e.g. -1) is returned to indicate that the target value is not present in the array.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">public class LinearSearchExample
{    
public static int linearSearch(int[] arr, int key)

<h2 class="h3">25) What is data abstraction in a Database system?</h2>
<p><strong>Data abstraction:</strong></p>
<p>Data abstraction is a method that allows users to interact with a database without being exposed to its internal details. Its purpose is to simplify database design and create an efficient user interface. By hiding irrelevant data, it provides an easier way for users to interact with the database.</p>
<p>There exist three stages of abstracting data:</p>
<p><strong>1. Physical level</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The lowest level of data abstraction is referred to as the physical level.</li>
<li>This content provides an explanation of how data is stored within a database.</li>
<li>Here's a rewritten version:

For developers, it's important to know the memory size needed to store records, as well as their access frequency. This information can help determine the minimum memory requirements for a system or application. Additionally, it can also impact the performance of the system, since frequent access to records can slow down operations if memory is not properly allocated. Therefore, it is essential for developers to optimize memory usage and access patterns when designing their software.</li>
<li>This level employs different techniques of organizing data, such as hashing, B+ tree, sequential, and others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Logical level</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The logical level can be considered as an essential level of data abstraction that sits in between the physical and conceptual levels.</li>
<li>This statement explains the nature of information stored in a structured format using tables.</li>
<li>Mapping is an important component of data analysis as it helps to visually represent and connect various data points and tables. With the help of mapping, it is possible to identify relationships between different pieces of data, making it easier to understand and draw conclusions from complex datasets.</li>
<li>Modifications made to one level will not have an impact on other levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. View level</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>View level is the highest level of data abstraction.
</li><li>At this tier, a user has access to a limited view of the real database.</li>
<li>Data can be viewed in the format of rows and columns by the user.</li>
<li>At this stage, users are able to easily interact with the database for improved functionality.</li>
<li>There are multiple ways in which a user can access data from a database, with various viewing options available for the same database.</li>

<h2 class="h3">27) Explain about daemon thread?</h2>
<ul class="points">
<li>Daemon threads are considered as subordinate threads in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that operate in the background and have low priority as compared to regular user threads. Their primary function is to provide support to the execution of user threads by performing certain tasks in the background.</li>
<li>Daemon threads are special types of threads that run in the background and are responsible for performing tasks like garbage collection.</li>
<li>If all the user threads have completed their execution, then daemon threads alone cannot prevent the JVM from terminating.</li>
<li>Even if a program contains only a daemon thread that is currently running, the program will still terminate the thread and shut down automatically.</li>
<li>The lifespan of a daemon thread is determined by the lifespan of the user threads in a program.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here are some techniques or approaches that can be employed for the implementation of daemon threads:</strong></p>
<ol class="points">
<li><strong>Rewritten:  
There is a method available that can set the status of a thread to either be a daemon or not. The method is called setDaemon and takes a boolean value as its parameter.</strong>: This method sets the current thread as user thread or daemon thread. </li>
<li><strong>Boolean isDaemon()</strong>: This method checks whether the current thread is daemon or not. It returns the true or false Boolean value.</li>

<p>A foreign key serves as a connecting link between two tables by being a field in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. The table that contains the foreign key is known as the child table while the table that features the candidate key is called the parent table.</p>
<p>Here are some key considerations to keep in mind when working with foreign keys:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>It is possible for a foreign key to have no value or be NULL.</li>

<h2 class="h3">29) What do you understand by serialization? </h2>
<ul class="points">
<li>Java's serialization feature involves transforming an object's present state to a sequence of bytes for transmission over a network or storage in a file.</li>
<li>Deserialization refers to the action of transforming a byte stream back into its original object form. It is the opposite of serialization, which is the process of transforming an object into a byte stream.</li>
<li>The series of bits transmitted as a stream during the execution of a process is not tied to any specific platform or JVM instance.</li>
<li>We can use <strong>java.io.Serializable interface</strong> to create an object serializable. This interface is a marker interface, which does not contain any data member or method. </li>
<li>Serialization in Java is implemented using two classes - ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream.</li>

<h2 class="h3">31) Why we use garbage collection in Java?</h2>
<p>In Java, when we create an object, it takes up a portion of memory. After the object has finished its task, it's important to remove it to free up memory for other objects. To accomplish this, garbage collection is utilized.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Java employs an automated process known as garbage collection to manage memory and ensure efficient memory usage.</li>
<li>It removes the objects that are not being used from the heap memory area, effectively deleting them.</li>
<li>In Java, the process of garbage collection is managed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) without the need for any specific method or function calls. The JVM automatically performs the task of garbage collection.</li>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>A static variable is a type of variable that pertains to the class itself rather than a specific instance of the class.</td>
<td>An instance variable is a type of variable that is associated with a particular object or instance of a class, and is not marked as static. This means that it can only be accessed through an instance of the class to which it belongs, as opposed to being accessible through the class itself.</td>

<h2 class="h3">35) What do you understand by Value type and Reference type in .Net framework?</h2>
<p>In the .NET framework, there are two types of data storage: value type and reference type. The type is determined by how the data is stored.</p>
<p>A data-type that stores the value within its own memory space is referred to as a Value type. These types allow direct assignment of values to a variable. Examples of value types include int, char, float, double, enum, and struct.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/igate-interview-questions-q35.png" alt="IGATE Interview Questions">
<p>A variable in programming can have either a value type or a reference type. Value types store the data directly, while reference types store a pointer to another memory location where the data is stored. As reference types only store the address of the data, modifying the address will create a new copy of the reference that still points to the same data. Examples of reference types include objects, arrays, classes, and interfaces.</p>

<h2 class="h3">36) Differentiate between graph and tree?</h2>
<p>Both tree and graph are examples of non-linear data structures that are comprised of nodes and edges. However, there are notable distinctions between the two.</p>
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Graph</th>
<th>Tree</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It is possible to have multiple paths in a graph.</td>
<td>A tree structure allows for only a single route to exist between any two nodes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The given graph does not have any starting point node.</td>
<td>The data structure has a singular primary node.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A visual representation that depicts the relationships or connections between various elements of a system or dataset is called a graph, which serves as a network model.</td>
<td>A tree is a structural representation that portrays a hierarchy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A graph does not have a fixed number of edges as it can vary depending on the specific graph being analyzed.</td>
<td>A tree can have n-1 edges where n represents the number of nodes in the tree.</td>

<h2 class="h3">37) Explain the difference between Abstract class and Interface? </h2>
<p>Abstraction can be achieved in Java through the use of Interface and Abstract classes. However, there are certain distinctions between these two approaches.</p>
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Interface</th>
<th>Abstract class</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>An interface is a programming construct that contains only abstract methods, meaning methods that lack an implementation.</td>
<td>An abstract class is capable of containing both abstract as well as non-abstract methods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>To indicate that we are creating an interface in programming, the keyword "interface" is typically used.</td>
<td>To define an abstract class, the term "abstract" is used to indicate its abstract nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The functionality of multiple inheritance is supported by the Interface.</td>
<td>An abstract class cannot incorporate multiple inheritances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>To implement an interface in a class, the keyword "implements" can be utilized.</td>
<td>To utilize an abstract class in another class, the keyword "extends" is necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The methods defined in an interface are by default public and abstract, and cannot have any other type of access modifiers.</td>
<td>Abstract classes support various access modifiers such as public, private, and protected, in addition to the abstract modifier.</td>

<h2 class="h2 center">THIRD ROUND: HR interview round.</h2>
<hr>
<p>The HR round is a crucial part of the recruitment process as it's the final stage of the interview. The questions asked in this round are based on the candidate's resume, job profile, and the company. The HR round aims to assess the candidate's communication skills, confidence, and impact. To help you prepare for this round, we've provided a list of common questions asked during an HR interview along with suitable answers.</p>
<h2 class="h3">1) Brief about yourself within a minute?</h2>
<p>The initial question in an HR interview is typically a request for candidates to introduce themselves. This query serves as a test of the interviewee's poise and ability to articulate a clear self-description. Some tips for responding to this question include demonstrating confidence and fluency.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Please provide me with some information about yourself in a concise manner that I can relay to the interviewer.</li>
<li>Could you please provide me with more information about your educational background and achievements?</li>
<li>Sure, I'd be happy to help you rephrase your content. Can you please provide me with the original content so that I can get started?</li>
<li>Could you please provide me with the original content that needs to be rephrased? Without it, I cannot generate a plagiarism-free version.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<blockquote>Hello, my name is Riya and I come from Chandigarh. I have recently completed my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication from Chandigarh University with a 75% aggregate. My expertise in programming includes Java, as well as C/C++. One of my academic projects involved the implementation of Artificial Intelligence technology. In my leisure time, I enjoy writing poems and coming up with innovative thoughts. I am confident about my abilities and I feel capable of handling any situation. My ultimate goal is to establish myself as a proficient name in the IT sector. Thank you!</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">2) Do you have any prior experience?</h2>
<p>Employers often ask about your work experience during a job interview. Your response will vary depending on whether or not you have any prior experience.</p>
<p><strong>I cannot provide a rephrased content without the original content to work with. Please provide the original content so that I can assist.</strong></p>
<blockquote>Certainly! I have worked as a software tester for a year in a company called ABC. Throughout my role, I was accountable for ensuring that the software met the necessary criteria and produced optimal results. In this experience, I gained a wealth of knowledge in software testing and was even recognized as the most committed worker in the organization.</blockquote>
<p><strong>If you have no prior experience in the relevant field:</strong></p>
<blockquote>As a recent graduate, I don't have any previous job experience and am currently on the lookout for an opportunity to kick-start my career.</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">3) If you got an option to choose between money and career, what will you prefer?</h2>
<p>This question is asked by hiring managers to understand whether or not money plays a significant role in your decision making process. While answering this question, it's important to keep in mind that both money and career growth are important factors. A good approach to answering this question could be providing a balanced response that highlights your priorities and values.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<blockquote>I believe that while money is undoubtedly important, it is not the only aspect of life that matters. For me, achieving success in my career is equally important as it can offer me growth opportunities and help me fulfil my personal goals.</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">4) Who is your inspiration for life and why?</h2>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<blockquote>I draw my inspiration in life from my father who I consider as a superhero. He possesses great strength and courage to confront any situation without fear. His motivational skills, leadership qualities, and unwavering commitment to his duties inspire me a lot. Despite facing numerous challenges, he never backs down but remains positive and happy. I wish to emulate him by developing a similar mindset and attitude towards life.</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">5) What is your short-term and long-term goal for the career?</h2>
<p>The most frequently asked question during an interview is about your career goals. The interviewer asks this question to assess your level of interest in the job and to determine how career-focused you are in relation to the company. It is important to ensure that your long-term and short-term goals are aligned when answering this question.</p>
<p> Example :</p>
<blockquote>As an aspiring individual, I aim to gain hands-on experience in the latest technologies as my immediate objective. In the long run, I hope to become a valuable team member of this reputable organization by demonstrating the best of my abilities.</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">6) What is your greatest strength and weakness?</h2>
<p>To answer this question, you need to highlight your unique strengths that distinguish you from other candidates and connect them to the requirements of the job. When addressing weaknesses, avoid revealing negative traits such as fatigue or other unfavorable qualities that could harm your chances of getting hired.</p>
<p> Example :</p>
<blockquote>I can confidently handle any type of situation which is my strongest trait. However, I have a weakness of being very emotional at times.</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">7) Tell something about our company?</h2>
<p>The interviewer may ask this question to gauge your knowledge about the company. It is essential to research the organization's profile, its products, and services before appearing for the interview. Therefore, it is good to be prepared and knowledgeable about the company.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">8) Are you ready to relocate to other location? </h2>
<p>Sure, I can help with that. Here's a rephrased version of the content:

When asked whether a company provides education or training programs to its employees, the candidate should avoid inquiring about whether or not the company will cover the cost. Additionally, it's important to refrain from responding to the question in a negative manner. Instead, focus on the type of education or training that you feel would benefit you in your role and inquire if the company provides such resources. This way, you can showcase your interest in professional development and highlight how you believe the company can help you achieve your career goals.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<blockquote>I am open to moving to a new location to pursue a promising career opportunity, and I strongly feel that this company aligns with my career aspirations.</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">9) Do you have also applied for other jobs?</h2>
<p>The interviewer is trying to gauge your level of commitment to job interviews and how seriously you take the job application process. When answering this question, it's important to keep your response concise and not come across as overly confident even if you have other job offers.</p>
<p>Assuming that you come across a favorable circumstance, for instance, an opening for a job position or a chance to do something exciting, what would you do?</p>
<blockquote>I have received job offers from two different companies, but I am most interested in the opportunity to work for this particular organization. It has always been my dream to work for this company.</blockquote>
<p>You have not submitted your application yet.</p>
<blockquote>As of now, I haven't submitted any job applications aside from my current employment, but I am getting ready to apply for another position within the same field.</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">10) Do you have any problem while working with the team?</h2>
<p>It is important to avoid providing a negative response when asked if you are comfortable working in a team, as teams are typically essential to completing various projects in any organization.</p>
<p> Example :</p>
<blockquote>I enjoy working collaboratively with others as a team player. It fosters a positive atmosphere for me to complete projects and achieve goals.</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">11) Would you like to ask any question to me?</h2>
<p>This inquiry is commonly stated at the conclusion of an interview. It is the final opportunity for a candidate to ask any queries they may have regarding the job description, career advancement, and so forth. This is the interviewer's chance to give the candidate a chance to inquire, and if they ask a good question, they may leave a positive impression which may aid them in the future.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h3">12) Do you know anyone who is already working with us? </h2>
<p>This is a challenging question that interviewees must be aware of. The interviewer's intention is to learn about your relationship with someone who is already employed at the company. Therefore, it is advisable to review the following suggestions before answering this question.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Before taking any steps, make sure to refer to the company's policies to see if there are any rules about employing family members or relatives.</li>
<li>If the individual you are familiar with has a good standing in the organization, it is advisable to mention their name.</li>
<li>We cannot just copy and paste someone else's content. Please provide me with the original content that you want me to rephrase.</li>
</ul>
