<h3 class="h3">10) What do you understand by *args and **kwargs in data engineering?</h3>
<p>This is a challenging question related to data engineering expertise. In-depth knowledge of coding concepts is required to successfully tackle this question, and it is a common type of inquiry in data engineering interviews.</p>
<p>In Python, both *args and **kwargs are utilized to indicate that a function can take any number of arguments. *args is used to outline a function in a particular order while **kwargs represents an unordered argument that can be used in a function. Essentially, *args deals with regular arguments (such as myFun(1,2,3)), while **kwargs deals with keyword arguments (for example, myFun(name="jtp")).</p>
<p>Suppose you want to create a function that adds numbers, but there is a limitation as it can only accept a certain amount of arguments.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Here is a customary function that calculates the sum of numbers. It requires a single parameter of type list.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
def sum_numbers(numbers):
   the_sum = 0
   for number in numbers:
       the_sum += number
 return the_sum
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>We can utilize this tool to calculate the total amount.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
sum_numbers(numbers)
>>> 21 
</textarea></div>
<p>In the given code, the function has a parameter named "args" which allows passing in any number of arguments as a tuple. This allows for more flexibility when calling the function, as it avoids the need to explicitly define a list of arguments.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
def sum_numbers(*args):
   the_sum = 0
   for number in args:
       the_sum += number
   return the_sum
sum_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
>>> 21 
</textarea></div>
<p>The purpose of using *args in Python is to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. This is useful when you don't know how many arguments you'll need ahead of time. On the other hand, **kwargs allow you to unpack dictionaries as keywordarguments. Imagine you need to multiply three numbers that come from a dictionary. While the keys remain the same, the values change. In this case, **kwargs are handy.</p>
<p><strong>The following backend code is presented as a straightforward example.</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
def multiply(a, b, c):
    return a * b * c
Following is the data you got:
d = {'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 5}
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>A simple approach:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
multiply(a=d['a'], b=d['b'], c=d['c'])
>>> 30
</textarea></div>
<p><strong>By using **kwargs:</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
multiply(**d)
>>> 30
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">11) What is the difference between a Data Warehouse and an Operational Database?</h3>
<p>Operational databases are designed for faster and efficient data insertion, updating, and deletion through SQL statements. However, data analysis using these databases can be challenging due to their primary focus on speed. Data warehouses, on the other hand, specialize in aggregations, calculations, and select statements, making them an excellent choice for data analysis.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">12) What are the different design schemas used in data modeling?</h3>
<p>There are two common approaches used for designing data models. These methods consist of specific schemas that can be employed to structure and organize data.</p>
<p>The star schema is a common and straightforward schema utilized in data mart schema. It involves categorizing model tables as either dimension or fact. In dimension tables, business entities such as products, people, places and time are specified. This modelling approach is widely adopted by relational data warehouses.</p>
<p>The star schema is a popular approach used to construct data warehouses and dimensional data marts. It is also related to the snowflake schema. By design, the star schema is optimized for easy and efficient querying of data.</p>
<p>The snowflake schema is a popular type of database schema used for multidimensional databases. It differs from the star schema, as instead of having separate tables for each dimension, the dimensions are often normalized into multiple related tables. This results in a snowflake-like structure in the entity-relationship diagram. The centralized fact table is linked to the multiple dimensions, allowing for efficient querying of data.</p>
<p>The snowflake schema is a database design structure that is commonly used in data warehousing. It typically occurs when dimension tables have a high level of detail and structure, with multiple levels of relationships and parent tables for child tables. This schema predominantly affects the dimension tables, rather than the fact tables in the database.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">13) What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Star schema?</h3>
<p>Here are the main benefits and drawbacks of using a Star schema:</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of using a Star Schema:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>The use of this tool simplifies the process of making queries.</strong> Star schema uses very simple join logic in comparison to other join logic, which requires fetching data from a transactional schema that is highly normalized.</li>
<li><strong>"Business reporting logic is made simpler by using it."</strong> Transactional schema is highly normalized compared to the star schema. So, the star schema clarifies common business reporting logic, such as as-of reporting and period-over-period.</li>
<li><strong>No design of cubes is necessary.</strong> All OLAP systems use star schema to design OLAP cubes efficiently. Most OLAP systems deliver a ROLAP mode of operation using a star schema as a source without designing a cube structure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Possible rephrased version:

Star schema has some drawbacks that need to be considered before deciding to use it as a data model. These downsides include:

- Data redundancy: The denormalized structure of star schema can lead to duplicate data, which can waste storage space and cause consistency issues if updates are not properly managed.
- Query performance: While star schema can make data querying simpler and faster for certain types of queries, it may not be optimal for more complex queries that require joining multiple tables. In such cases, a more normalized schema may be preferable.
- Maintenance complexity: Managing a star schema can be more challenging than a simpler schema, as it requires updating multiple tables and ensuring data consistency across them. Changes to the schema or data can also impact many areas of the system, making testing and debugging more difficult.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The star schema is a denormalized schema that may compromise data integrity. Due to its highly de-normalized state, data integrity may be inadequately enforced.</li>
<li>The data model is not strongly normalized, which makes it inflexible for analytical purposes requiring a normalized data model.</li>
<li>The star schema is not designed to facilitate relationships between business entities that have many-to-many connections.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">14) What are the main components of a Hadoop application?</h3>
<p>The following is a compilation of the fundamental elements that make up a Hadoop application:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>HDFS:</strong> HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System. It is the primary data storage system used by Hadoop applications. This file system stores the Hadoop data. It uses NameNode and DataNode architecture to implement a distributed file system that provides high bandwidth, high-performance access to data across highly scalable Hadoop clusters.</li>
<li><strong>Hadoop Common:</strong> This is a common set of utilities and libraries utilized by Hadoop.</li>
<li><strong>Hadoop YARN:</strong> This is mainly used for resource management within the Hadoop cluster. We can also use it for task scheduling for users.</li>
<li><strong>Hadoop MapReduce:</strong> It is used for large-scale data processing.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">15) What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Snowflake schema?</h3>
<p>The Snowflake schema has several advantages and disadvantages that should be considered when designing a database. It is important to weigh both the benefits and the drawbacks in order to determine if this schema is the most appropriate for the needs of the project.</p>
<p><strong>One possible rephrased version could be: "There are various benefits to utilizing the Snowflake schema."</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The Snowflake schema offers enhanced data quality as compared to other schemas. Since the data is highly structured in this schema, the possibility of data integrity issues is minimised, making such errors infrequent.</li>
<li>The snowflake schema is designed to store normalized data with minimal redundancy, resulting in less disk usage compared to denormalized models. This is achieved by breaking down the data into multiple tables and normalizing them, reducing the duplication of data.</li>
<li>The Snowflake schema model has minimal risks of data integrity breaches and redundancy, resulting in an easier maintenance process.</li>
<li>The Snowflake schema offers a greater potential for complex, in-depth queries than the star schema. This allows for more extensive analytical capabilities and greater space for data mining applications.</li>
<li>The Snowflake schema is capable of accommodating relationships that involve multiple entities on both sides of the relationship, commonly referred to as many-to-many relationships.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3">19) What do you understand by NameNode in HDFS?</h3>
<p>The NameNode is a crucial component of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Acting as the primary node, it is responsible for overseeing and regulating the various blocks that exist on the slave nodes (DataNodes) within the Hadoop architecture.</p>
<p>The NameNode serves as the central repository of all HDFS data and maintains a registry of files across clusters. It is a robust server that oversees the File System Namespace and authorizes client access to files. It is important to understand that the data is stored in DataNodes rather than the NameNode itself.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">20) What are DataNodes in HDFS?</h3>
<p>DataNodes are a crucial component of HDFS, serving as the storage nodes for the actual data. Unlike NameNodes, which are the master nodes, DataNodes are considered as the slave nodes. Multiple DataNodes can be present in a functional file system, where the data is replicated across them. The primary responsibility of DataNodes is to handle read and write requests from clients. When activated, a DataNode connects itself to the NameNode, waiting for it to become operational.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">21) What are the key differences between NameNode and DataNode in Hadoop?</h3>
<p>The following information outlines the primary distinctions between NameNode and DataNode components in a Hadoop cluster.</p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>NameNode</th>
<th>DataNode</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NameNodes play a crucial role in the functioning of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) as they are responsible for managing and controlling the HDFC. They are also known as the Master or central point in the Hadoop cluster.</td>
<td>DataNodes play a crucial role in storing the business data in HDFS. They are commonly referred to as the Slave in the Hadoop cluster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The NameNode functions as a central repository for managing metadata information related to the storage of data in a distributed file system. It serves as a directory tree for all files in the file system and tracks them throughout the cluster. Some examples of the metadata it stores include the file name, path, number of data blocks, block identification numbers, block locations, number of replicas, and slave-specific configurations.</td>
<td>The role of the DataNode in Hadoop is to function as the primary working node, responsible for handling data processing, reading, and writing operations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The NameNode in HDFS is in charge of assembling the complete file by using the information it maintains about the location and list of blocks belonging to that file.</td>
<td>The DataNode maintains continuous communication with the NameNode to carry out its tasks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The NameNode is a crucial component in the functioning of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). If the NameNode stops working, the entire HDFS/Hadoop cluster becomes inaccessible and is deemed as non-functional.</td>
<td>DataNode may not be considered as a critical component unless it faces downtime. Its unavailability does not impact the accessibility of data or the functioning of the cluster. NameNode takes care of managing the replication of blocks in case any of the DataNodes encounter an outage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The NameNode is usually equipped with ample memory resources, particularly RAM, as it stores the block locations of the file system in its primary memory.</td>
<td>A DataNode is typically equipped with a significant amount of storage capacity as it serves as the physical location for storing actual data.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">22) What do you understand by Block and Block Scanner in HDFS?</h3>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">23) What is Hadoop streaming?</h3>
<p>Hadoop offers various useful utilities and Hadoop streaming is one of them. This tool is widely used for creating maps and performing reduction operations with ease. It also allows submission into a designated cluster.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">24) What are some important features of Hadoop?</h3>
<p>The popularity and reliability of Hadoop as a Big Data tool can be attributed to several impressive features it possesses. These features make Hadoop stand out in the industry and give it immense power for handling large amounts of data.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Hadoop is a software framework that is free to use and open-source. The framework's code is available online, allowing anyone to access it and make modifications to customize it according to their industry needs. It is a versatile tool that can be used for a variety of tasks.</li>
<li>One of the advantages of Hadoop is its fault tolerance feature, which ensures data availability even in the event of system failure. In Hadoop, data is replicated across multiple DataNodes within a Hadoop cluster, enabling easy retrieval of lost data. In order to guarantee data availability, Hadoop makes three copies of each file block and distributes them across different nodes by default.</li>
<li>Hadoop allows for speedy data processing through its capability for parallel computing.</li>
<li>Hadoop employs a distributed data storage approach by keeping data on separate clusters apart from the operations.</li>
<li>Hadoop ensures that data is readily available with its high availability feature. The Hadoop cluster's fault tolerance allows for uninterrupted access to data. In the event of a DataNode failure, data is retrievable from other replicated nodes, ensuring continuity of operations.</li>
<li>Hadoop comes equipped with the capability to maintain data redundancy, which is vital for safeguarding against potential data loss.</li>
<li>Hadoop offers a cost-effective solution for handling Big Data as it eliminates the need for expensive hardware and high-end processors typically required by traditional relational databases.</li>
<li>Hadoop is a software framework that has been designed to handle diverse types of data effectively. The system is versatile and can manage structured information like MySQL data, semi-structured content like JSON or XML, and unstructured data like videos and images. This feature makes Hadoop highly adaptable to multiple datasets.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">25) What happens when Block Scanner detects a corrupted data block? How does it handle this?</h3>
<p>If a Block Scanner identifies that a data block is corrupted, it proceeds through a series of actions.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Once a corrupted data block is identified by the Block Scanner, the DataNode sends a report to the NameNode.</li>
<li>Upon detecting a corrupted block, NameNode initiates a process to replace it with a new replica. It does so by creating a fresh block using the original, malfunctioning one as reference.</li>
<li>In the process of data replication, the original data is copied and distributed across multiple nodes in a cluster to ensure redundancy and availability. To avoid data loss, the system also creates replicas of the data blocks in case of any corruption or failure. The replication factor determines the number of replicas that will be created. Once the replicas are in place, the system verifies the correct number of replicas and compares it with the replication factor. If the numbers match, any corrupted data block will not be deleted.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">26) How does the NameNode communicate with the DataNode? / What are the two messages that NameNode gets from DataNode?</h3>
<p>The communication between the NameNode and the DataNode occurs through messaging, with two specific types of messages being transmitted between them.</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Block reports</li>
<li>Heartbeats</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">27) What steps should we follow to achieve security in Hadoop?</h3>
<p>To ensure security in Hadoop, certain measures are required to be taken, including performing specific steps.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>To ensure the safety of the interaction between the client and the server, we should begin by securing the method through which the client is verified and authenticated. Additionally, it is important to provide the client with timestamped information to ensure accuracy and accountability.</li>
<li>After the client receives a time-stamped from the authentication server, it then uses the received time-stamped to request for a service ticket from the Ticket Granting Server (TGS).</li>
<li>The final stage of the Kerberos authentication process involves the client presenting a service ticket to authorize their connection to a particular server via self-authentication.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">28) What is Combiner in Hadoop?</h3>
<p>A crucial function in Hadoop that helps to alleviate network traffic congestion is known as Combiner. This function serves as an intermediate step between Map and Reduce, and is provided by the Hadoop framework. Its purpose is to process the output data generated by the Mapper before transmitting it to the Reducer. Combiner takes the output of the Map function, transforms it into key-value pairs, and then passes it on to the Reducer for further processing. Essentially, Combiner summarizes the final result from Map into summary records with an identical key. It executes after Map and before Reduce.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">29) What do you understand by Heartbeat in Hadoop?</h3>
<p>The Heartbeat is a communication message utilized in Hadoop between the NameNode and DataNode. This message is sent by the DataNode to the NameNode to show that it is active and present. The Heartbeat is sent on a regular basis to establish and maintain the connection between the NameNode and DataNode.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">30) What do you understand by data locality in Hadoop?</h3>
<p>When dealing with Big Data systems, it's impractical to move huge amounts of data over the network for computation. Instead, Hadoop utilizes data locality, which involves bringing the computation close to where the data is stored, rather than transferring large amounts of data for computation. This technique helps reduce network traffic and increases the system's overall computation capacity. By keeping the data local to its stored location, the process is referred to as data locality.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">31) What is the full form of FSCK in HDFS?</h3>
<p>FSCK is a crucial command in HDFS, short for File System Check. Primarily used to identify and resolve issues and inconsistencies within files, it is a fundamental tool in HDFS.</p>
<hr>
