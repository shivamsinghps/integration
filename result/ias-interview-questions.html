<h1 class="h1">IAS Interview Questions</h1>
<p>The Indian Administrative Service (IAS) is a government service whose candidates are recruited following a tough selection process by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). The selection process includes a three-part examination comprising Prelims, Mains, and an Interview. The Interview section is known to be the most significant as it plays a crucial role in determining the best candidate for the job. Passing this exam guarantees placement in the IAS as one of the most respected government services in India.</p>
<p>The IAS Prelims and Main exams are designed to evaluate the knowledge and general awareness of candidates on various topics. In contrast, the IAS Interview is used to assess the personality and temperament of civil service aspirants.</p>
<h2 class="h2">The UPSC examination Pattern</h2>
<p>To enter IAS, one must pass three exams, including preliminary, mains, and an interview round.</p>
<p>The Prelims is the first stage of the examination, comprising of multiple-choice questions. It is widely regarded as a rigorous test because the questions are original and not sourced from any material. Furthermore, each question carries the same weightage with a probability of 25% chance of being answered correctly.</p>
<p>The second stage of the civil service examination is known as the Mains. This round is subjective in nature and evaluates a candidate's writing style and knowledge presentation. Candidates who clear the preliminary round are eligible to appear for the Mains. The candidate's ability to provide detailed answers and demonstrate their knowledge is assessed in this paper.</p>
<p>In the third round of the IAS exam, candidates who have qualified mains must undergo an interview. The interviewers are typically experienced IAS officers. During the interview, candidates can expect to be asked questions that aren't covered by textbooks.</p>
<p>This interview test assesses various personality traits.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Mental alertness</li>
<li>Critical powers of assimilation refer to the ability to comprehend and integrate new information in a deep and reflective manner. This includes the capacity to engage with diverse perspectives, question assumptions, and synthesize ideas in a way that enhances one's understanding.</li>
<li>This content needs to be changed significantly so that it is not a copy of the original. Try using different sentence structures, synonyms, and changing the tone of the writing.</li>
<li>Social traits</li>
<li>Having an awareness and understanding of recent events and news is crucial for academic and professional growth. Keeping up-to-date with current affairs is essential for expanding our knowledge and perspective on the world around us.</li>
<li>Balance of judgment</li>
<li>The range and level of curiosity and enthusiasm for different subjects.</li>
<li>Social cohesion refers to the capacity of individuals in a community to work together in a harmonious way towards a shared objective. It is an essential aspect of any healthy society as it promotes peace, understanding, and mutual respect among its members.</li>
<li>Leadership skills</li>
<li>"Intellectual and moral integrity" is a phrase used to describe the ethical values of honesty, transparency, and doing what is right, even when it is difficult. It encompasses a dedication to living and acting in accordance with one's beliefs and values, and a commitment to upholding high standards of personal and professional conduct. Those who possess intellectual and moral integrity are seen as trustworthy and reliable, and are respected for their principles and integrity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2">Common Interview Questions and Assessment</h2>
<p>After being successful in both the preliminary and main examinations, candidates are required to take part in a personality or interview test. During this test, UPSC officials will ask questions related to the applicant's detailed application form.</p>
<p>One can inquire about a variety of topics during an interview such as place of origin, areas of interest, local issues, national concerns, and more.</p>
<p>During an interview, the questions asked can vary depending on the candidate's background, interests and experience. For example, if the candidate is from a certain state or region, they may be asked questions related to their local culture or politics. Similarly, if the candidate belongs to a famous tourist destination, they may be asked about the prominent places or attractions in the area. Personal interests and hobbies can also influence the questions asked during an interview. For instance, a candidate who enjoys gardening may be asked about soil types, various vegetables and herbs, and gardening techniques. Prior work experience can also influence the types of questions asked.</p>
<p>During a job interview, the interviewers may ask questions related to your job profile to assess your knowledge and experience in that field. For instance, if you have been employed as an engineer, they may inquire about your expertise in the area of technology, innovation or any other relevant topics. As you answer their queries, it gives them an opportunity to observe your interaction and response to each question.</p>
<p>In this interview round, the panel endeavors to evaluate whether your responses reflect a broader Indian perspective or are more representative of a particular region's mentality.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Situational Interview Questions</h2>
<p>The panel conducting the interview may prepare their own questions based on various scenarios and situations to assess the candidate's ability to tackle them effectively in the role of a district collector. These could include emergencies such as earthquakes, fires, and floods, and evaluate the candidate's response to such situations. The panel may also ask challenging questions to test the candidate's abilities.</p>
<p>These types of questions are used to test the mental agility and problem-solving abilities of potential candidates in challenging situations. Employers use them to see how well they can think under pressure and come up with logical solutions.</p>
<h4 class="n">Note: The UPSC Interview 2020 will take place tentatively in March and April 2021.</h4>

As a result, they have been holding demonstrations and blocking highways in various states, demanding that the government rescind the bills.</li>
<li>Shaheen Bagh Protest</li>
<li>The revocation of Article 370 is the act of abolishing the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir under the Indian Constitution.</li>

The law criminalizes any speech or action that is seen as bringing hatred or contempt towards the government, the country's national symbols or institutions.

<li>The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 is a law passed in India that amends the existing laws related to motor vehicles.</li>
<li>India has implemented measures to control its population growth. These measures include education and awareness campaigns about family planning, access to contraception and other forms of birth control, and financial incentives for couples who have fewer children.

It also proposes the creation of a national committee on dam safety, which will be responsible for providing guidance and direction to state committees on dam safety. The Dam Safety Bill is an important piece of legislation that aims to address the safety concerns associated with dams and reduce the risks posed by these structures.</li>

A possible rephrased version could be: The restructuring and division of the state of Jammu and Kashmir is a significant political development that has recently taken place in India.

<p>During job interviews, interviewers often ask both tricky and straightforward questions. It's important to not stress too much about these questions and instead provide a practical and diplomatic response that comes to mind. The interview questions may sometimes be phrased in a confusing manner, so it's helpful to rephrase them into a simpler question and answer accordingly. Even seemingly pointless questions may actually have a logical purpose behind them.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="h2padding">Questions Generally asked by the Interview Panel</h2>
<h3 class="h3">1) Why do you want to join the civil services? / Why do you want to join the civil services if you can do well by doing social work?</h3>
<p>Many individuals aspire to become an IAS officer due to their strong emotional connection to the profession. Being an IAS officer is considered one of the most prestigious government jobs in India with unlimited power and influence. Furthermore, civil services offer a chance to make a positive impact in society while also reaping financial benefits and job security. However, it is important for responses regarding this question to be tactful and encompass all aspects of the topic.</p>
<p><strong>I'm sorry, I cannot provide a rephrased content unless I am given the original content to work on. Please provide me with the content that needs to be rephrased.</strong></p>
<blockquote>I have a strong desire to enter civil services because I am committed to serving the country and delivering positive changes to society. My goal is to contribute to the well-being of the nation and its people through my work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>My desire to become an IAS officer stems from wanting to make a positive impact on the lives of people in my region. As an IAS officer, I would be responsible for implementing policies, overseeing developmental initiatives, and managing administrative affairs. Additionally, I could hold leadership positions in government ministries, departments, and socio-economic institutions, as well as represent our nation in international forums.</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">2) Why do you want to join civil services even though the salary is limited?</h3>
<p>This is a challenging and complex question that lacks a clear and definitive answer. Responses may vary greatly between individuals, as personal opinions and experiences shape one's perspective on the topic. Therefore, two different candidates are not likely to have identical answers.</p>
<p>The reasons for joining the military may vary from person to person. Some may be motivated by the desire to serve their country, while others may be attracted to the power and prestige that come with the job. Additionally, being in a leadership position and having the opportunity to perform various assignments may also be factors that motivate some individuals to join the military.</p>
<p><strong>Sure, here's a rephrased version of the content:

Provide an alternate wording or phrasing for the given content so that its original meaning is retained, but it is not copied verbatim from the source material.</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, being an IAS officer is the most desirable job in India. It's a career that isn't motivated by high salaries, but rather, the opportunity to serve in influential and prominent roles within the government. India is a country that's still emerging and aiming to provide as much support as possible to its people, and IAS officers play a significant role in crafting and executing national policies. As a result, they have many chances to innovate and solve problems, making ideas a reality. One more reason to pursue an IAS career is that it encourages remarkable professional growth, allowing officers to work in a variety of government departments. The range of assignments and professional advancement opportunities are quite satisfying for anyone.</p>
<p>My desire to become an IAS officer is driven by several factors. Firstly, I have always been passionate about serving my country and helping people in need, and I believe joining the IAS will allow me to make a positive impact on society. Secondly, the job security and stability provided by a position in the civil services is essential for me as I want to build a successful career. Additionally, the opportunity to work on a diverse range of challenging projects and initiatives is an exciting prospect. Furthermore, the honour and prestige that comes with being an IAS officer is a significant draw for me.</p>
<p>Rewritten: Individuals who are preparing for the civil services or IAS exam usually have their own personal thoughts and mindset about these career paths. During the interview, it's important to express your own beliefs and ideas in a clear and direct manner to the interview panel.</p>
<p>Avoid attempting to make a false impression on the interview panel by lying and bragging about things like:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>I intend to eliminate dishonesty and illegality.</li>
<li>My goal is to elevate India to become one of the top countries in the world.</li>
<li>Obtaining IAS qualification will give me the authority to facilitate positive changes wherever I am assigned.</li>
<li>My goal is to eliminate poverty.</li>
</ul>
<p>This content appears to have been copied from an external source. It is important to always use your own words and avoid plagiarism. Here is a suggested rephrased version:

It is crucial to communicate clear and specific statements during job interviews. If your statements are vague or lack logical backing, you may receive criticism from the interviewer. It is important to be prepared to provide evidence to support your statements and make a strong impression on the interviewer.</p>
<p>You should aim to communicate in a way that is both thoughtful and responsive. In other words, speak purposefully and be prepared to provide further information or answer follow-up questions.</p>
<p>It is acceptable to acknowledge when you lack knowledge on a particular subject or topic by simply stating "I don't know."</p>
<p>When conducting an interview, it is essential to avoid making irrelevant comments since they can lead the conversation astray and harm the overall experience. It's important to keep in mind that the interviewee is likely a highly intelligent individual. Being friendly, authentic, and clear in your speech is key.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">3) What is special about your date of birth? Any important event took place that year?</h3>
<p>If someone asks you about a specific date, you need to provide them with historical or notable events that occurred on that day. For instance, if your birth date is April 23rd, 1992, you can mention any significant or interesting facts that took place on that day.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>On the 23rd of April 1992... 

The 23rd day of April in 1992...</strong>, India's most eminent filmmaker Satyajit Ray dies, leaving a huge void in Indian cinema, which is yet to be filled. He was the only filmmaker from India to win an Oscar.</li>
<li><strong>On the twenty-third day of April in the year of 1564, an event took place.</strong>, the great English poet William Shakespeare was born. He also died on his birthday on 23rd April in the year 1616.</li>
<li><strong>The information provided is already in its original form and cannot be plagiarized. However, if you would like a rephrased sentence, you can try: "The 23rd of April in 1972 marked a significant event."</strong> Apollo 16 astronauts (John W. Young, Thomas K Mattingly II, Charles M. Duke Jr.) explores Moon's surface.</li>
<li><strong>The date of 23rd April 1920 marks an important event.</strong> the Ottoman Empire in Turkey ended.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous interesting pieces of information that you could share with the interview panel.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">4) What is your ambition or aim in life?</h3>
<p>Ambition or aim is the strong desire to accomplish something important. If the question about ambition is posed during the UPSC interview, then you have undoubtedly attained a significant goal that you have set for yourself.</p>
<p>One possible rephrased version could be:

"My ultimate career goal is to become a responsible and empathetic officer, dedicated to addressing the concerns of the people in my community. By contributing as an officer, I hope to make a positive impact on the development of my country. My belief is that hard work and a positive outlook can make any achievement possible, and I am committed to proving this true."</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">5) You have opted for arts subjects in UPSC when you are an engineer. Why did you choose that subject?</h3>
<p>In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of engineering graduates who opt for humanities subjects while appearing for the UPSC exams. This trend is due to the fact that engineering students are able to develop better analytical abilities through the practical pedagogical methods used in their four-year engineering courses. As a result, an increasing number of engineering graduates are able to crack the UPSC exam, thereby making this a popular career path for them.</p>
<p>A significant contributing factor to so many engineers appearing in the UPSC exams is the cultural emphasis on academic success in India, where the brightest students are typically pushed towards pursuing a career in Engineering or Medicine. These fields attract students who have a strong aptitude for competitive exams, which is why it's not surprising to see a significant number of engineering students taking the UPSC exam. Arts graduates, on the other hand, may not have received the same level of preparation for this type of exam.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">6) How can I select my subjects in UPSC if I am from an engineering background?</h3>
<p>The UPSC exam allows you to choose subjects based on your preference, and your educational background doesn't matter. For civil services like IAS/IFS/IPS exams, only one optional subject needs to be chosen, while two are required for IFoS. If you have an engineering degree, Mathematics can serve as a suitable subject option due to your prior understanding. However, it's important to pick a subject that genuinely interests you. Mathematics is also not as conventionally coached compared to other subjects, so self-studying may be required.</p>
<p>If you lack confidence in Mathematics, it would be advisable to concentrate on the significant subjects of art, which are History, Geography, Polity, and Economics.</p>
<p>Choose a topic that you find engaging and have confidence in your ability to answer questions on it. Look through past exam papers for this subject to assist you in preparing. The advantage of narrowing your focus is there are many resources, such as coaches and study materials, that can aid you in your studies. Seek guidance from someone who is knowledgeable on the topic. This could be a coaching centre or any trusted acquaintance.</p>
<p>In addition to History, Political Science, and Economics, students could consider pursuing a degree in Public Administration. However, it's important not to choose subjects such as Mechanical, Civil, or Electrical engineering if you're not confident, as these require a lot of time and effort.</p>
<h4 class="n">Note: Choose your optional only on your interest. Remember your optional subject is a very crucial factor to get you in the final list.</h4>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">7) How to choose the optional subject for UPSC Civil Services Exam?</h3>
<p>There are certain factors that need to be considered when selecting an Optional Subject for the UPSC exam.</p>
<p><strong>Rewritten: The interests and academic background of a candidate are crucial factors to consider in their pursuit of a particular goal. These aspects provide insight into the individual's passions, strengths, and potential for success in the chosen path. Understanding an aspirant's interests and academic background is important in making informed decisions about their career or educational pursuits.</strong></p>
<p>To select your Optional subject, it's crucial to consider your interest in a particular field. One way to determine this is by referring to NCERT textbooks for classes 11th and 12th, reviewing the Optional subject syllabus, and assessing your comfort level while studying the subject.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<p>If you have a background in Commerce, consider the subjects you've studied in college and use this to guide your decision between pursuing Commerce, Management, or Public Administration.</p>
<p>(b) For Engineering students considering optional subjects, it's important to review both the syllabus and content offered for options like Physics, Chemistry, Maths, or one of the Engineering electives (Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical). However, if these science subjects are not appealing to the student, alternative options include subjects such as Geography, Psychology, Anthropology, Political Science, Sociology, Public Administration, or Philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>2. Guidance and instructors accessible for the specific discipline.</strong></p>
<p>To find reliable coaching classes for civil service exam preparation, you can seek advice from experienced individuals such as seniors, successful candidates, or civil servants. They can guide you in identifying the highest quality education facilities in your area, and combined with the study materials provided, can enhance your chances of passing the exam.</p>
<p><strong>Rewritten: The impact of the elective subject on the overall curriculum of general studies.</strong></p>
<p>The significance of this topic should not be overlooked as it holds great value for many candidates who choose humanities subjects as their optional due to the comprehensive coverage of general knowledge that it provides.</p>
<p><strong>Rewritten: Evaluating the performance of the elective subject within the last three years is important.</strong></p>
<p>The scores attained by candidates in the UPSC exam can differ significantly due to various factors. Some frequently chosen optional subjects may not yield the desired marks despite a candidate's best efforts. Hence, it is advisable to steer clear of such subjects.</p>
<p><strong>5. Time Management</strong></p>
<p>Effective time management plays a crucial role in cracking the UPSC exam. Aspirants need to carefully allocate their time for studying their Optional Subject while also factoring in their work or academic commitments. It is essential to select an Optional Subject based on the time available for studying along with the preparation required for General Studies. This ensures a balanced approach towards cracking the UPSC exam.</p>

<p>The following is a challenging mathematical query that demands proficiency and careful execution. Its purpose is to gauge your cognitive power and overall aptitude.</p>
<p>One possible way to solve the equation given in the question is to use the mathematical signs of plus and minus within the brackets. However, it is unclear from the question prompt whether this method is allowed. The resulting equation would be (15 - 9) + (13 - 7) + (7 - 1) + (9 - 1) + (13 - 9), which simplifies to 6 + 6 + 6 + 8 + 4 = 30 after solving each set of brackets.</p>

<h3 class="h3">21) Suppose you have a scooter that has two tires and one stepni (spare tire). Each tire can run 50 km. How long can a scooter run?</h3>
<p>The three-wheeled scooter has a capacity to run 50 kilometers per tire, making a total distance of 150 kilometers. Nevertheless, two tires are needed at any given moment to operate the scooter. Therefore, the maximum distance that can be accomplished using the scooter is 75 kilometers.</p>
<p>Let us analyze how the highest possible distance could be attained in this scenario. We can refer to the three wheels as A, B, and C.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The combined distance that can be covered by tires A and B is 25 kilometers, while tire C has a capacity of 50 kilometers remaining.</li>
<li>The combined distance travelled by tires B and C would be 25 kilometers, with tire A having a capacity of 25 km remaining, tire B having reached its capacity, and tire C also having a capacity of 25 km.</li>
<li>The combined distance travelled by tires A and C would be 25 kilometers, as tire B had already reached its maximum capacity and could not continue, while tire C had also used up its capacity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The distance traveled is equal to the sum of the distances covered in each segment. In this case, the sum of the distances traveled in all three segments is 75 kilometers.</p>

<h3 class="h3">26) What is the difference between vision, mission, goals, and objectives?</h3>
<p>In my perspective, a vision can be seen as the ultimate goal or objective that one intends to achieve. It encompasses a wide range of ambitions and aspirations that one may have in any given field or context. For instance, a government may have a vision of ensuring that governance is accessible to every person in the society, even those who may be considered to be the most vulnerable and marginalized.</p>
<p>A mission is a statement that outlines the approach of achieving a broader vision. Essentially, the methods and tactics employed to reach the overarching vision are encapsulated in a mission statement. It can take various forms, such as leveraging technology to enhance service delivery, implementing environmentally sustainable practices, or fighting poverty. In contrast, a goal is a statement that identifies what needs to be achieved to put a strategy in place, while objectives are specific actions or milestones set within a timeframe towards accomplishing a goal.</p>

<h3 class="h3">28) A farmer has some chickens and goats. If everyone has 90 heads and 224 legs, then what will be the number of goats?</h3>
<p>The answer to the number of goats is 22.</p>
<p>Rewritten: The given problem involves finding the number of chickens and goats present in a certain group. Let x represent the number of chickens and y represent the number of goats.</p>
<p>I cannot provide a rephrased content without knowing the original content that needs to be paraphrased. Please provide the original content to avoid plagiarism.</p>
<p>x+y= 90</p>
<p>We can create an equation to represent the number of legs chickens and goats have together. Since chickens have 2 legs and goats have 4 legs, we can let x represent the number of chickens and y represent the number of goats. Thus, the equation is 2x + 4y = 224.</p>
<p>2(x+y=90)</p>
<p>Rewrite the following text using original words and structure:

"2x + 4y = 224"</p>
<p>Reword the following statement to avoid plagiarism: 

"2 x + 2 y = 180"</p>
<p>We can rewrite the statement as "If we subtract the value of x from the sum of x and y, we get 44." This implies that the equation can be simplified to 2y = 44 after simplifying x.</p>
<p>The value of the variable y is 22.</p>
<p>According to the problem at hand, there are a total of 72 animals in a farm consisting of only goats and chickens. The number of legs of these animals combined is 200. With the help of a system of equations, it was solved that there are 50 chicken and 22 goats.</p>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">2) Where would Lord Rama have celebrated his "First Diwali"?</h3>
<p>Determining whether Lord Rama celebrated Diwali or not requires both theoretical and practical knowledge. According to popular belief, Lord Rama may have celebrated his first Diwali upon returning to Ayodhya from his 14-year exile as the citizens welcomed him. However, historical evidence suggests that Diwali actually commemorates the slaying of Narakasura by Lord Krishna. As Lord Krishna's incarnation occurred after Lord Rama's, it can be inferred that Diwali celebrations did not take place during Lord Rama's time.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">3) Which Indian temple disappears twice a day?</h3>
<p>Stambheshwar Mahadev Temple is reputed for its unique feature of disappearing twice daily. The temple, which is dedicated to Lord Shiva, holds great historical significance in India and is among the oldest shrines in the country.</p>
<p>The Stambheshwar Mahadev Temple can be found in the village of Kavi Kamboi, situated in Jambusar in the state of Gujarat. Its unique location just a few meters away from the seashore means that it disappears when the tide is high and reappears when the water level recedes. As the sea level rises twice daily, visitors can witness the temple completely submerge underwater during high tide and then emerge again during low tide.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">4) What is the full form of IP?</h3>
<p>The term IP stands for 'Internet Protocol'.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">5) What is the national song of India? / What is our national song?</h3>
<p>The national song of India is 'Vande Mataram,' which was created by Bankimchandra Chatterji in Sanskrit. This song played a significant role in inspiring people during the freedom struggle.</p>
<p>The content talks about a general knowledge question related to India's national symbols. Many candidates get confused between the national anthem "Jana Gana Mana" and the national song "Vande Mataram". "Vande Mataram" is the national song of India, while "Jana Gana Mana" is the national anthem. Hence, it is important to keep in mind the difference when answering such questions.</p>

<li>Can you describe any projects that you worked on during your academic studies, whether it was in school, during your undergraduate degree, or in graduate school?</li>
<li>Can you describe yourself as an average pupil? If so, what makes you think that way?</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Questions generally asked on Current Affairs.</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>Can you tell me about the latest news stories and what's making headlines today?</li>
<li>Can you provide more details on the news in question and what specifically you need rephrased? It's important to properly cite or paraphrase sources to avoid plagiarism.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are certain questions which can be asked during an interview to gauge the level of knowledge and interest of the interviewee about current events and news. These may include asking about trending news stories globally, nationally or locally, and also requesting for recent significant news about the candidate's state or hometown.</p>
<h4 class="n">Note: For UPSC aspirants, it is very important to read newspapers and follow the daily news. You can face a lot of questions related to the latest news topics in the Interview. Your answer should be diplomatic. Avoid giving a one-dimensional opinion for any question.</h4>
<h3 class="h3">Questions generally asked on Work profile.</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>Can you describe the tasks and duties you were responsible for in your previous job?</li>
<li>What motivates you to pursue a career as an IAS/IPS/IFS officer?</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="n">Note: Prepare yourself well if you have any gap between your Education and your work history. You can also explain how your previous work experience can help you in your career as an administrator.</h4>
<h3 class="h3">Questions generally asked on Optional Subject.</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>Can you tell me what motivated your decision to select this option?</li>
<li>Could you please tell me the reason for not choosing your graduation subject as your optional subject?</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Questions generally asked on Hobbies</h3>
<p>The interview panel may ask questions related to the hobbies mentioned in your Detailed Application Form (DAF). For instance, if you have listed sports as a hobby, you can expect to be asked about famous sportspersons, upcoming sports events, or the latest results in the field. Similarly, if you have mentioned singing as your hobby, you can be prepared to answer questions about the latest trends in the music industry or even sing a few lines during the interview.</p>
<h3 class="h3">IAS Interview Preparation Strategy</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>One can stay updated with current events by regularly reading a few newspapers each day and keeping up with ongoing affairs.</li>
<li>Sure, I can help you rephrase content to avoid plagiarism. However, I need the original content to do so. Please provide me with the content you want me to rephrase.</li>
<li>Here's my attempt: 

One way to prepare for answering demonstration questions is to practice in front of a mirror. Practicing this way will help you become more confident and comfortable with your answers.</li>
<li>Reword the given text to avoid plagiarism and create original content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary objective of the IAS interview questions is to evaluate if a candidate is suited to the workings of administration. It is not necessary to answer all questions in order to score well on the UPSC Personality Test. The focus of the interview is not always on knowing the exact answer to the question, but rather on how the candidate responds to the situation. Therefore, the most crucial factor is how the candidate handles themselves in such a scenario.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Few key points to avoid in an IAS interview</h2>
<ul class="points">
<li>It's important to avoid stress on the day before an interview. Make sure to get a good night's sleep, take a nap if needed, and stay calm.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to deceive the interviewer during the IAS interview. This interview is unlike any other that you may have experienced previously, so it is best to be honest and genuine.</li>
<li>It is advisable for candidates not to engage in arguments with the panel members during a discussion. Although it is a platform for exchange of ideas, maintaining decorum at all times is important.</li>
