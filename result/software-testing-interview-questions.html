<h1 class="h1">Software Testing Interview Questions</h1>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/software-testing-interview-questions.png" alt="Software Testing Interview Questions" class="imageright">
<p>Here are some commonly asked questions during software testing interviews or interviews for QTP (QuickTest Professional) and their corresponding answers.</p>
<h3 class="h3">1) What is the PDCA cycle and where testing fits in?</h3>
<p>The software development process typically involves four steps, which are commonly known as PDCA.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/software-testing-interview-questions2.png" alt="Software Testing Interview Questions">
<p>One possible rephrased version of the content is:

PDCA is an acronym that represents a continuous improvement model used to achieve better results in various areas. It includes four steps: planning, doing, checking, and acting. This iterative process allows individuals, teams, or organizations to identify areas for improvement, create a plan, implement changes, evaluate the outcomes, and adjust accordingly until the desired outcomes are achieved. By using PDCA, individuals and organizations can continually refine their processes, enhance their performance, and meet their goals effectively and efficiently.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Plan:</strong> It defines the goal and the plan for achieving that goal.</li>
<li><strong>Do/ Execute:</strong> It depends on the plan strategy decided during the planning stage. It is done according to this phase.</li>
<li><strong>Check:</strong> This is the testing part of the software development phase. It is used to ensure that we are moving according to plan and getting the desired result.</li>
<li><strong>Act:</strong> This step is used to solve if there any issue has occurred during the check cycle. It takes appropriate action accordingly and revises the plan again.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project developers handle the tasks related to project planning, designing and implementing the code while testers are responsible for ensuring that the project meets all the necessary requirements by carrying out thorough testing.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">2) What is the difference between the white box, black box, and gray box testing?</h3>
<p>Black box testing is a testing approach that relies solely on the software's requirements and specifications. It does not require any understanding of the software's internal structure, implementation, or flow.</p>
<p>White box testing is a testing approach that is based on the internal workings of the software being tested, such as code structure, implementation, and paths. It requires extensive programming knowledge for accurate testing.</p>
<p>Gray box testing is a form of testing whereby the tester has some insight into the implementation of the system. It involves partially opening the box being tested to gain an understanding of how it works before conducting black box testing.</p>
<p><strong>The differences between white box, black box, and gray box testing can be outlined as follows:</strong></p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>Black box testing</th>
<th>Gray box testing</th>
<th>White box testing</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Black box testing does not require any knowledge of the internal workings or implementation details of a software program.</td>
<td>Gray box testing involves conducting tests on a program with partial knowledge of its internal workings.</td>
<td>White box testing involves a thorough understanding of a program's implementation details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>One way to rephrase this content could be: "The level of detail in the data is not high, as it lacks specific and detailed information."</td>
<td>The content displays a moderate level of granularity.</td>
<td>The level of detail in this item is quite precise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This type of testing is referred to by different names such as opaque box testing, data-driven testing, functional testing, input-output testing, closed box testing, and behavioural testing.</td>
<td>Translucent testing is a testing technique that is often used in software development. It involves testing the system in a way that allows for transparency and visibility into the testing process.</td>
<td>This type of testing is referred to as clear box testing, glass box testing, or structural testing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The type of testing being described is known as user acceptance testing, and it is typically conducted by individuals who will ultimately be using the product or service being tested.</td>
<td>This type of testing is performed by the end-users to ensure that the application meets their requirements and works as expected. It is known as user acceptance testing.</td>
<td>The task is usually performed by software developers and software testers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Functional specifications guide the creation of test cases as they provide the necessary details for testing, while internal details are not typically disclosed.</td>
<td>Test cases are created based on the specific workings and logic of a program.</td>

<h3 class="h3">3)What are the advantages of designing tests early in the life cycle?</h3>
<p>Creating tests during the early stages of development can help to catch and eliminate defects before they become part of the final product.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">4) What are the types of defects?</h3>
<p>In the context of quality control, there are three main categories of defects which are wrong, missing, and extra.</p>
<p>These defects appeared because the requirements were implemented incorrectly.</p>
<p>This content discusses the use of the word "missing" in describing a specification that was not implemented or a requirement that was not properly noted by the customer.</p>
<p>An "Extra" refers to a feature that is added to a product but was not originally requested by the customer. It is a divergence from the specifications, but may still be a desirable attribute. However, the defect is considered as it varies from the user's needs.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">5) What is exploratory testing?</h3>
<p>Exploratory testing refers to the practice of simultaneously designing and executing tests against an application. Testers use their knowledge of the system's domain and testing experience to anticipate areas where the system may behave unexpectedly. This approach relies heavily on the tester's intuition and ability to uncover bugs through dynamic, interactive testing.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">6) When should exploratory testing be performed?</h3>
<p>Exploratory testing is conducted as a last line of defense before the software is launched. It is a supplementary task to automated regression testing.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">7) What are the advantages of designing tests early in the life cycle?</h3>
<p>Avoiding defects in code can be achieved with the help of code review, which is a process that involves examining code thoroughly to ensure that it is error-free.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">8) Tell me about the risk-based testing.</h3>
<p>The strategy of risk-based testing involves prioritizing tests based on the level of risk. This approach is based on a thorough analysis of the potential risks and categorizing them according to their level of urgency. The most critical risks are addressed first to ensure optimal results.</p>
<hr>

<ins class="adsbygoogle cm_jtp_wtc_responsive" style="display:inline-block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4699858549023382" data-ad-slot="6746133113"></ins>
<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<h3 class="h3">9) What is acceptance testing?</h3>
<p>Acceptance testing is an important stage in software development where the user or customer is given the opportunity to evaluate the software product based on agreed criteria. The main objective of this level of testing is to ensure that the software is acceptable to the user. It validates the system's ability to meet the expectations of the users by checking if it performs all the required functions as expected.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/what-is-acceptance-testing.png" alt="Software Testing Interview Questions">
<p><strong>There are various categories of acceptance testing.</strong></p>
<ol class="">
<li><strong>User acceptance testing</strong>: It is also known as end-user testing. This type of testing is performed after the product is tested by the testers. The user acceptance testing is testing performed concerning the user needs, requirements, and business processes to determine whether the system satisfies the acceptance criteria or not.</li>
<li><strong>Operational acceptance testing</strong>: An operational acceptance testing is performed before the product is released in the market. But, it is performed after the user acceptance testing.</li>
<li><strong>The process of testing the compliance of contracts and regulations is known as contract and regulation acceptance testing. This involves checking whether the contracts and regulations meet all the necessary requirements.</strong>: In the case of contract acceptance testing, the system is tested against certain criteria and the criteria are made in a contract. In the case of regulation acceptance testing, the software application is checked whether it meets the government regulations or not.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha and beta testing are two types of software testing processes used to identify and fix issues before the final product is released to the public. Alpha testing is done by a select group of users, while beta testing is open to a larger group. Both testing processes are important for ensuring the quality and functionality of the software before it becomes widely available.</strong>: Alpha testing is performed in the development environment before it is released to the customer. Input is taken from the alpha testers, and then the developer fixes the bug to improve the quality of a product. Unlike alpha testing, beta testing is performed in the customer environment. Customer performs the testing and provides the feedback, which is then implemented to improve the quality of a product.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">10) What is accessibility testing?</h3>
<p>Accessibility testing is conducted to assess whether a software product can be accessed by individuals with disabilities, such as those who are deaf, blind, or mentally disabled.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">11) What is Adhoc testing?</h3>
<p>Ad-hoc testing is a type of testing that involves randomly testing the system's features to uncover any issues or faults. The goal is to ensure that the system can handle real-world scenarios and identify any weaknesses that may exist.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">12) What is Agile testing?</h3>
<p>Agile testing is a type of software testing that involves the use of agile methodologies. This methodology uses test-first design principles to ensure efficient testing of software products.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">13) What is API (Application Programming Interface)?</h3>
<p>An API or Application Programming Interface is a set of pre-defined software calls and routines that can be utilized by an application program to access various system or network services.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">14) What do you mean by automated testing?</h3>
<p>Automated testing refers to the process of utilizing software tools to carry out tests without relying on manual intervention. This approach can be employed for various types of testing, including GUI, performance, and API testing.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">15) What is Bottom-up testing?</h3>
<p>Bottom-up testing is a testing strategy that involves testing the lowest level components first and then moving to the higher level components. The approach proceeds in an incremental manner until the top-level component has been tested. In this way, each component is thoroughly tested before integration with higher-level components and reduces the risk of errors and bugs in the final product.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">16) What is Baseline Testing?</h3>
<p>Baseline testing involves running a series of tests to gather data on the performance of an application. Using this information, adjustments can be made to improve the capabilities and efficiency of the application. Baseline testing enables a comparison between the current performance of an application and its previous performance. The goal of this testing is to identify areas that need improvement and make necessary changes to optimize the application's performance.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">17) What is Benchmark Testing?</h3>
<p>Benchmarking testing is the method of evaluating the performance of an application by comparing it with the standard set by another organization in the industry.</p>
<p>This refers to a common evaluation process used to ascertain the position of our application compared to others.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">18) Which types are testing are important for web testing?</h3>
<p>Web testing involves two essential types of testing that are critical to ensure the quality and functionality of a website.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Performance testing</strong>: Performance testing is a testing technique in which quality attributes of a system are measured such as responsiveness, speed under different load conditions and scalability. The performance testing describes which attributes need to be improved before the product is released in the market.</li>
<li><strong>Security testing</strong>: Security testing is a testing technique which determines that the data and resources be saved from the intruders.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">19) What is the difference between web application and desktop application in the scenario of testing?</h3>
<p>A web application is distinct from a desktop application in that it can be accessed from anywhere in the world with multiple users accessing it simultaneously at different times. Therefore, it is crucial to carry out load testing and stress testing to ensure that it can handle the traffic. Web applications are also susceptible to attacks such as DDOS, making security testing vital.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">20) What is the difference between verification and validation?</h3>
<p>Reword:The distinction between verification and validation:</p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>Verification</th>
<th>Validation</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The process of Verification in software testing is a type of Static Testing that involves evaluating software or its components without actually executing it.</td>
<td>The statement can be rephrased as "Dynamic Testing, or the process of continuously testing software during its development, is a form of validation."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Verification is typically conducted before validation.</td>
<td>Validation is a process that takes place subsequent to Verification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Verification is a process where plans, documents, requirements and specifications are examined to ensure that they meet certain criteria or standards. This examination helps to detect any errors or issues that may arise during the implementation of the plan or project.</td>
<td>Validation evaluates products.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>One way to perform verification is by utilizing certain tools and techniques such as checklists, issue lists, walkthroughs, and inspections. These inputs help ensure that a product or project meets its intended requirements and specifications.</td>
<td>In invalidation testing, the product undergoes actual testing to ensure its functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The result of the verification process includes various documents such as plans, requirement documents, specifications, and other related materials.</td>
<td>The result produced by the invalidation process is the actual product.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">21) What is the difference between Retesting and Regression Testing?</h3>
<p>Sure, here's my attempt:

Here are some distinctions between Retesting and Regression Testing:</p>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<th>Regression</th>
<th>Retesting</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Regression testing is a method utilized in software testing to verify that changes made to an application's code do not negatively impact its existing features and functionalities.</td>
<td>Retesting involves performing checks on the previously unsuccessful test cases during the final execution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The primary objective of regression testing is to ensure that any modifications made to the code do not have any impact on the existing functionalities.</td>
<td>The process known as retesting is used to verify that defect fixes have been successful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Verifying defects is not a component of Regression testing.</td>
<td>Defect verification is a crucial component of the regression testing process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Automating regression testing can save time and money compared to manual testing. This is because manual testing can be costly and time-consuming.</td>
<td>Retesting cannot be automated by any means.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>One alternative way to say this is: "Generic testing is another name for regression testing."</td>
<td>A possible rephrased version could be: Planned testing is an alternative term for retesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Regression testing involves conducting tests on previously passed test cases in order to ensure that changes and modifications do not negatively impact the software's functionality. On the other hand, retesting involves re-executing failed test cases in order to ensure that any issues identified in earlier testing have been resolved.</td>
<td>It is possible to carry out regression testing and retesting in parallel to ensure comprehensive testing. However, retesting should be given priority over regression testing as it is crucial to confirm that defects have been fixed properly.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">22) What is the difference between preventative and reactive approaches to testing? </h3>
<p>Preventative tests are created during the software development process to identify and prevent potential issues before they occur. In contrast, reactive tests are created after the software has been developed, and are used to identify and fix issues that have already arisen.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">23) What is the purpose of exit criteria?</h3>
<p>The criteria that signify the end of a test level are referred to as exit criteria. They are employed to ascertain the completion of the particular testing phase.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">24) Why is the decision table testing used?</h3>
<p>A table used for decision-making purposes is composed of input values in one column and corresponding outputs in the same column but arranged beneath the input values.</p>
<p>Decision table testing is a method of testing systems that are defined by a set of rules or cause-and-effect combinations. It involves testing various combinations of inputs to determine the resulting outputs that are produced. The table serves as a reminder of the inputs and the corresponding outputs that are expected.</p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">25) What is alpha and beta testing?</h3>
<p>Here are the main distinctions between alpha and beta testing:</p>
<table class="alt">
<tr><th>No.</th><th>Alpha Testing</th><th>Beta Testing</th></tr>
<tr><td>1)</td><td>This task is typically performed by professionals working at the site of software development.</td><td>The service is carried out by clients at their location at all times.</td></tr>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">26) What is Random/Monkey Testing?</h3>
<p>Random testing, also referred to as monkey testing, is a technique of software testing where data is generated in a haphazard or arbitrary manner, often utilizing automated tools. The data is produced either through a tool or an automated mechanism.</p>
<p>Random testing has certain restrictions and shortcomings:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The majority of randomly generated tests are unnecessary and not reflective of real-world scenarios.</li>
<li>Further evaluation and assessment is required to obtain a complete understanding of the findings.</li>
<li>If you fail to document the data that was utilized for testing, it is not viable to replicate the test.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">27) What is the negative and positive testing?</h3>
<p>Negative testing refers to a technique in software testing where an invalid input is provided to check if the system correctly identifies and reports errors.</p>
<p>Positive testing refers to the process of inputting valid data and verifying that the expected actions are carried out in line with the specified requirements.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">28) What is the benefit of test independence?</h3>
<p>Checking for test independence is highly advantageous as it eliminates the potential influence of the author's biases in determining the effectiveness of the tests.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">29) What is the boundary value analysis/testing?</h3>
<p>Boundary value analysis/testing is a technique that involves testing only the boundaries of the value range, rather than testing all values within that range. For instance, if a bank allows customers to withdraw between 100 and 25,000 dollars, boundary value testing would only test values above and below these limits. By examining these limits, we can cover all possible scenarios that might occur within the given range.</p>
<p>This diagram depicts the boundary value testing strategy for the bank application mentioned earlier. We only need to use TC1 and TC2 to test all conditions for the bank, while TC3 and TC4 are unnecessary and redundant test cases that don't provide any additional value. Through the appropriate application of boundary value principles, we can eliminate duplicate testing and ensure that all essential scenarios are covered.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">30) How would you test the login feature of a web application?</h3>
<p>There are numerous methods available for assessing the login functionality of a web application:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>To test if your login is valid, log in using your credentials, then exit the browser and reopen it to see if you are still logged in.</li>
<li>To ensure that you have successfully logged out of a website, first sign in and then log out. Afterwards, return to the login page and check if you are still logged in. This will confirm if the logout process was effective.</li>
<li>After logging in, if you navigate back to the initial page, will you be prompted to log in again?</li>
<li>It is crucial to prioritize session management when working on web development projects. This involves determining the method by which we identify users who have logged in to the system, such as through web sessions or cookies.</li>
<li>One way to test if you're still signed in to a website is to open a new browser window or tab and see if you're already logged in. This can help ensure that your login session has not expired and that you don't need to sign in again.</li>
<li>One possible rephrased version of the content would be: 

Try logging in, changing the password, and logging out, and then test if you're able to log back in using the previous password.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3">31) What are the types of performance testing?</h3>
<p>Performance testing is a vital aspect of software testing that evaluates the system's performance under different load conditions, including speed, scalability, and stability. Prior to launching a product in the market, it's crucial to subject it to performance testing to ensure its optimal performance.</p>
<p><strong>There are various kinds of software testing that can be performed.</strong></p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/types-of-performance-testing.png" alt="Software Testing Interview Questions">
<p><strong>1. Load testing:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Load testing is a method used to evaluate a system's performance by gradually increasing the amount of load until it reaches a certain threshold value.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="n">Note: An increasing load means the increasing the number of users.</h4>
<ul class="points">
<li>The primary objective of load testing is to evaluate how quickly a system responds when it is subjected to an increasing amount of load.</li>
<li>Load testing is a type of testing that aims to evaluate the non-functional requirements of a system. In other words, it focuses on testing the system's ability to handle a certain level of load or traffic without compromising its performance.</li>
<li>Load testing is a critical process that verifies a system's capability to handle a large amount of load or traffic. It checks whether the system can function efficiently without any performance degradation under extreme stress conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Stress testing:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Stress testing is an approach used to evaluate a system's ability to perform under the strain of limited hardware resources such as insufficient CPU power, low memory capacity, and limited disk space.</li>
<li>The purpose of stress testing is to examine the software's performance when the system is under heavy load with numerous processes and limited hardware resources.</li>
<li>Stress testing is carried out to detect possible system failures and determine the system's ability to recover from such failures, known as recoverability.</li>
<li>One way to test for non-functional requirements is through stress testing. As the name suggests, this type of testing applies stress to the system to check how it performs under extreme conditions. This type of testing falls under non-functional testing, which focuses on aspects such as reliability, performance, and usability, among others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Spike testing:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Spike testing is a type of load testing that focuses on testing the application's stability under varying loads. It is performed to identify any inconsistencies and weaknesses in the system when subjected to short bursts of a high number of users or requests. Its objective is to ensure that the application can handle sudden and unexpected spikes in traffic without crashing or showing poor performance.</li>
<li>There are different cases to be considered during testing:
<ul class="points">
<li>One solution is to restrict the number of users in order to prevent overloading the system.</li>
<li>The second scenario involves giving caution to additional participants, which could result in a longer response time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Endurance testing:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Endurance testing is a form of testing that falls under the category of load testing. It involves analyzing the system's behavior and performance over an extended period of time.</li>
<li>Endurance testing is a type of testing that evaluates the capability of the system to maintain performance under sustained workload without failure. This type of testing focuses on testing non-functional requirements of the system.</li>
<li>Soak testing is another name for endurance testing.</li>
<li>Endurance testing is an evaluation process that identifies potential problems such as memory leaks. When an application does not release its assigned memory after use, it creates a memory leak. This issue occurs when the application is used for extended periods, and the unusable memory can cause problems. Endurance testing checks for these issues to ensure that the application can handle long-term use without any negative consequences.</li>
<li>Some of the main issues that are viewed during this testing are:
<ul class="points">
<li>The occurrence of memory leaks was attributed to the functioning of an application.</li>
<li>A situation arose where the occurrence of memory leaks was related to a connection that was established for a database.</li>
<li>The presence of a third-party software caused the occurrence of memory leaks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Volume testing:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Volume testing is a method used to test a system's ability to handle large amounts of data. This is done by gradually increasing the volume of data and examining how the system performs as the volume escalates.</li>
<li>The term "flood testing" is used interchangeably with volume testing.</li>
<li>Volume testing falls under the category of non-functional testing, which involves testing only the non-functional requirements.</li>
<li>To conduct volume testing, one may need to increase the size of the database by adding more data into the table before performing the test.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Scalability testing</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Scalability testing is a crucial method that verifies the system's ability to perform optimally as the user demands increase.</li>
<li>Following are the attributes checked during this testing:
<ul class="points">
<li>Response time</li>
<li>Throughput</li>
<li>The required number of users for conducting a performance test needs to be determined.</li>
<li>Threshold load</li>
<li>CPU usage</li>
<li>Memory usage</li>
<li>Network usage</li>
</ul>
</li>
