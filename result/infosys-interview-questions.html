<h1 class="h1">Infosys Interview Questions</h1>
<p>Infosys is a technology company based in Bengaluru, India that specializes in consulting, information technology and outsourcing services. Under the trade name Infosys Technologies Limited, the company has established a strong reputation as a leading provider of innovative technology solutions.</p>
<p>Infosys has designed its recruitment and selection process to ensure that candidates are selected based on their aptitudes and how well they fit the company's requirements. This approach ensures a successful match between the candidate and the company.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Academic Conditions: </h2>
<ul class="points">
<li>Minimum 60% Aggregate in 10<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> Mark sheet.</li>
<li>A minimum score of 65% or higher in B.Tech. is required.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2">Company Recruitment and Selection Process </h2>
<p>In order to be selected for the Infosys interview, candidates must pass three rounds. The first round is an online test focused on logical reasoning and grammar. The second round is a technical interview where candidates will answer technical questions related to their field of expertise. The final round is the HR interview, which is a common step in many companies' recruitment and selection process.</p>
<p>The first round of Infosys recruitment and selection process evaluates candidates' grammar and IQ through an online test. The test includes questions related to analytical thinking and may vary in content, but the focus remains on language and logical skills. This round is of moderate difficulty and success can be achieved by having good communication skills and IQ level.</p>
<p>For the second stage of the recruitment and selection process, applicants are required to take a Technical Test. A good understanding of technical concepts is necessary for passing this test. As the Technical Test is often the most challenging round, one should pay close attention to the interviewer's questions. It aims to evaluate candidates' technical skills and proficiency, which they have gained from previous work experience.</p>
<p>The third round of the job interview process is typically a face-to-face meeting with a Human Resource Manager. If you have successfully completed the second round, you will be eligible to participate in the HR round. During this round, the HR manager will ask you questions about the company and your personal background. It is important to remain calm and composed during the HR round, as the questions will not be technical in nature. Your communication skills will be tested as you will be required to discuss yourself and the company.</p>

<ol class="pointsa">
<li>6%</li>
<li>7.5%</li>

</ol>
<button class="showanswer" onclick="showhide(15)"><span id="btntext15">Show Answer</span></button>
<div class="testanswer" id="answer15">
<p>This content should be rewritten in a way that paraphrases the original text, without copying its structure or wording. Since no original text is provided, I cannot provide a rephrased version.</p>
<p> Solution:   
Let the rate be X% p.a. 
Then, 1200 x 1 + X 2 = 1348.32 
100  
1 + X 2 = 134832 = 11236 
100 120000 10000 
1 + X 2 = 106 2 
100 100  
1 + X = 106

1/2 = 1/2 
(1/2)/2 = 1/4 
(1/4)/2 = 1/8 and so on.</p>

<h2 class="h3">2) Gaurav's age after 15 years will be 5 times his age 5 years back. What is the present age of Gaurav?</h2>
<ol class="pointsa">
<li>10 years</li>
<li>18 years</li>
<li>20 years</li>
<li>It is not possible to determine the answer.</li>
<li>None of these</li>
</ol>
<button class="showanswer" onclick="showhide(21)"><span id="btntext21">Show Answer</span></button>
<div class="testanswer" id="answer21">
<p>This content should be rewritten in a way that paraphrases the original text, without copying its structure or wording. Since no original text is provided, I cannot provide a rephrased version.</p>
<p>Here is a possible rephrased version of the given solution: 

To find Gaurav's present age, we can use the information given in the problem. Let's assume that Gaurav's current age is x. We know that his age after 15 years would be x + 15 and his age 5 years ago would have been x - 5. 

We can then use the equation given in the problem: 

x + 15 = 5(x - 5) 

We can simplify this equation: 

x + 15 = 5x - 25 

Subtracting x from both sides: 

15 = 4x - 25 

Adding 25 to both sides: 

40 = 4x 

Finally, dividing both sides by 4: 

x = 10 

Therefore, Gaurav's present age is 10 years old.</p>

<div class="testanswer" id="answer23">
<p>Reword the text in a way that does not copy the original content.</p>
<p> Solution:  Given that: 
1. The difference of age b/w B and A = The difference of age b/w A and C. 
2. Sum of age of B and C is 50 i.e. (B + C) = 50. 
Question: B - A = ?.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p> B - A = A - C 
(B + C) = 2A 
Now given that, (B + C) = 50 
So, 50 = 2A and therefore A = 25. 
Question is (B - A) = ?</p>
<p> Here we know the value(age) of A (25), but we don't know the age of B. 
Therefore, (B-A) cannot be determined.</p>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">1) What is polymorphism?</h3>
<p>Polymorphism is a term used to describe the ability to perform a single action in a variety of different ways. This concept is derived from two Greek words - "poly" meaning many and "morphs" meaning forms. As a result, polymorphism refers to the idea of having multiple forms or variations of something.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">2) Explain the functionality of linked list.</h3>
<p>A linked list is made up of two components: information and link. In a single linked list, the start pointer identifies the first node in the list and each node's link is a pointer to the next node. However, the last node in the list has a null pointer. Traversing the linked list is simple with the aid of the Start pointer.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">3) What is normalization of databases, joins, and keys?</h3>
<p>Normalization refers to the method of efficiently organizing data in a database management system (DBMS) without losing any information.</p>
<p><strong>The benefits of implementing a normalization process include:</strong></p>
<p>To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of a database, one of the important steps is to get rid of unnecessary and duplicate data, while also making sure that the data relationships are logical and correctly organized. This has the advantage of minimizing the size of the database and ensuring that the data is consistently and logically arranged.</p>
<p><strong>Join:</strong></p>
<p>In database management systems, a clause is utilized to merge rows from multiple tables based on a related column. This operation is known as a join.</p>
<p><strong>Keys:</strong></p>
<p>In the relational database model, keys play a vital role in identifying and establishing relationships between tables. They are instrumental in uniquely determining each record or row of data present in a table.</p>
<p><strong>Key:</strong></p>
<p>A key may refer to a solitary attribute or a combination of attributes functioning as a key.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">4) What is inheritance?</h3>
<p>In programming that follows the object-oriented paradigm, the concept of inheritance is utilized through classes.</p>
<p>Inheritance is the concept in object-oriented programming where a child class can inherit properties and data members from a parent class. The parent class is also known as a super-class and the child class as a sub-class. When a class derives from another class, it can access and use the properties and data members of the parent class.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">5) What are the different types of inheritance?</h3>
<p><strong>Types of Inheritance:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Single inheritance</li>
<li>Multiple Inheritance</li>
<li>Multi-level Inheritance</li>
<li>Multi-path Inheritance</li>
<li>Hierarchical Inheritance</li>
<li>Hybrid Inheritance</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">6) Demonstrate the process of inheriting variable of one class to other class?</h3>

<h3 class="h3">7) What are the loops statements?</h3>
<p>Loops are utilized in programming to repeatedly execute a set of statements based on a conditional statement.</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/interview/images/infosys-interview-questions2.png" alt="Infosys Interview Questions">
<p>The loop structure involves checking a conditional statement before executing the loop, which should be evaluated in each iteration. In case the statement proves to be true, the loop will be executed, while if it returns false, the code will exit the loop.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">8) Difference between classes and interface?</h3>
<p>Below are the distinctions between classes and interfaces:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>To create an instance of a class, you can create an object of that class. However, interfaces cannot be instantiated because all the methods in an interface are abstract and do not have any implementation. Therefore, there is no need to create an instance of an interface.</li>
<li>The declaration of a class involves the use of the keyword "class," while an interface is declared using the keyword "interface."</li>
<li>An interface is a type of class that has its own set of members that are used to derive another class. Unlike regular classes that can have public, protected, and private access specifiers for their members, interface members are all declared as public because they are meant to be used by other classes. Therefore, there is no need to specify access modifiers within the members of an interface.</li>
<li>Classes and interfaces are both key components of object-oriented programming. While classes declare fields and methods for performing actions on those fields, interfaces only define abstract methods. In other words, classes provide a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and behaviors, while interfaces establish a set of requirements that classes must adhere to.</li>
<li>One key difference between classes and interfaces in object-oriented programming is that a class can inherit from only one superclass, but it can implement multiple interfaces. On the other hand, an interface cannot implement another interface, but it can extend multiple interfaces.</li>
<li>A constructor can be defined within a class to initialize the fields of the class, but an interface does not have any fields to be initialized, so it does not have a constructor defined.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">9) What is software development life-cycle? Also, explain the waterfall model.</h3>
<p>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured approach to developing and enhancing software projects. It involves creating a detailed plan to ensure the quality of the software and the development process.

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">22) Different between a session and a socket?</h3>
<p>A socket is formed by combining an IP address and a port number. A session is then established to create logical connectivity between the source and destination.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">23) What is a null pointer?</h3>
<p>A null pointer is a pointer that doesn't point to any memory location.</p>
<p>A pointer with a null value contains no memory address and is therefore empty. Null pointers can be utilized to set the memory address with the same data type of the pointer at a later time in the program.</p>
<h4 class="n">Note: Pointers can only point to the variable having the same datatype. If the data type of pointer and datatype of pointing variable is different, then the pointer will not work.</h4>

<h3 class="h3">27) Which functions are used for memory allocation in C/C++</h3>
<p>The calloc() function is used to allocate a memory area whose size is determined by multiplying its two parameters. This function initializes the memory with zeros and returns a pointer to the first byte of the memory. If the function fails to locate sufficient memory space, it will return a NULL pointer.</p>
<p>The malloc() function reserves a block of memory based on the length parameter provided. It does not initialize the memory. To release the memory allocated by malloc() and calloc() functions, the free() function is used. On the other hand, the new operator can also be used to allocate memory on the heap and initialize it with the constructor, while delete is used to release the memory allocated using the new operator.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">28) Write output of the program?</h3>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="cpp">
int i=10;

</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">29) What is a virtual function and what is the pure virtual function?</h3>
<p>Polymorphism is a concept of object-oriented programming where a function in the base class can be overridden in the derived class. To achieve polymorphism, we declare the function in the base class as virtual. This allows the base class pointer to execute the function of any derived class depending on the content of the pointer, i.e., depending on the address of the derived class.</p>
<p>A pure virtual function is a function declared in a base class that has no implementation and needs to be defined in a derived class. It is a way of enforcing implementation of specific functionality in derived classes, while allowing flexibility in the implementation of other parts of the derived classes.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="cpp">
virtual void fun()=0;
</textarea></div>
<p>When a function is declared as "virtual" in a base class and is assigned " = 0", it becomes a pure virtual function. Unlike a regular virtual function, it does not have an implementation in the base class. This means that any derived class must implement that function or also declare it as a pure virtual function.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">30) What are WPF-WCF? </h3>
<p>A software application is required using WPF/WCF and must be compatible with the .NET 3.0 Framework. The application will incorporate several concepts, including:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>WCF(Windows Communication Foundation)</li>
<li>The latest characteristics aimed at enhancing service provision.</li>
<li>Interfaces are a type of abstraction in object-oriented programming that defines a contract between different parts of a program. They allow for the separation of concerns, as classes can implement multiple interfaces to provide a specific set of behaviors without being tied to a particular implementation. The use of interfaces helps to improve code modularity, simplifies testing, and promotes code reuse. </li>
<li>Callback functions, which allow a function to be passed as an argument to be called later, are frequently used in programming.</li>
<li>Asynchronous delegates</li>
<li>Creating the proxy</li>
<li>WPF, which stands for Windows Presentation Foundation, is a technology used for the development of graphical user interfaces in Windows-based applications.</li>
<li>Styles</li>
<li>Templates</li>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Databinding</li>
<li>Here's a possible rephrased version:

If you want to make a WPF application faster and more responsive, you may want to consider using multithreading. This technique involves dividing your application's tasks into several threads that can run in parallel, allowing the application to process more tasks simultaneously. Multithreading can also help prevent your application from becoming unresponsive during heavy workloads, such as when performing complex calculations or accessing network resources.

To use multithreading in a WPF application, you need to create one or more background threads that will perform the heavy lifting, while leaving the UI thread free to handle user interactions and update the UI. You can do this by using the Task Parallel Library (TPL) or other threading frameworks, such as the Thread class. Once your background threads are running, you can use various synchronization techniques, such as mutexes or semaphores, to coordinate their actions and prevent race conditions.

Overall, multithreading can be a powerful tool for improving the performance and scalability of your WPF application, but it also requires careful design and testing to avoid common pitfalls such as deadlocks, thread contention, or data corruption. Therefore, you should always adhere to best practices and seek expert advice if you're not familiar with this topic.</li>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">36) What is the difference between array and pointer?</h3>
<p>An array is a collection of elements with the same data type, while a pointer is a variable that directs towards a data type in memory. Arrays can solely hold elements of the matching data type, meanwhile, the pointer variable can indicate any data type variable.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">37) How abstraction and encapsulation complementary?</h3>
<p>Abstraction and encapsulation are two core concepts in object-oriented programming that work together. Abstraction concentrates on the visible properties and actions of an object, whereas encapsulation focuses on the underlying code and structure that produces those properties and actions. Both concepts are essential in developing efficient, reliable software applications that can be easily modified and maintained over time.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">38) How is modularity present in C++?</h3>
<p>The idea of modularity in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the focus of this concept, which was first introduced in C++ through classes and objects. In C++, modularity is implemented using functions, classes, and structures.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">39) Define the structural difference between the b-tree index and bitmap?</h3>
<p><strong>Btree</strong></p>
<p>Bayer and McCreight created a hierarchical model known as a tree structure in 1972.</p>
<p>A balanced m-way search tree with a tree structure is referred to as a B-tree of order m. This means that a B-tree is essentially an m-way search tree.</p>
<p>The structure comprises of both leaf nodes and branch nodes.</p>
<p><strong>Bitmap</strong></p>
<p>A bitmap index is composed of binary digits that represent each unique value within a dataset. It allows for speedy access to specific rows in a table using a binary sequence. This type of indexing is ideal for columns with a limited number of distinct values.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">40) What do you mean by platform independence?</h3>
<p>Platform independence is the capability of a programming language or platform to be implemented on one machine and used on another without major changes. This type of independence can be classified into two categories: source platform independence and binary platform independence. Java is a binary platform independent language as it utilizes a Java Virtual Machine to run applications, while C and C++ are source platform independent because they rely on compilers to convert the source code to executable machine language.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">41) Differentiate between Char and Varchar in DBMS?</h3>
<p>Char and Varchar are two commonly used datatypes in DBMS for storing character information. While both datatypes can store characters up to a length of 8000, they differ in their properties. Char is a fixed length datatype that stores strings of a specific length, while Varchar is a variable length datatype that can store strings of varying lengths.</p>
<p>The difference between the char and varchar data types is that char takes a fixed amount of memory to store a string of a specified length, while varchar takes variable space and only uses as much memory as the data entered. This means that if a char is defined as char(7), it will always take up 7 bytes of memory even if the string only requires 4 bytes, whereas varchar will only use the necessary amount of memory for the data being stored.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">42) Do you know about the different level of languages?</h3>
<p>The following is a list of the various tiers or levels of programming languages:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Low-level Language</strong>- Language which is understandable by machine is often known as machine language (binary language). It is challenging to read and doing code in this language by humans directly.</li>
<li><strong>Assembly level language</strong>- Some mnemonics are used which reduce the complexity of the program.</li>
<li><strong>Middle-level Language</strong>- This language is not so tricky as the assembly language, but it still requires the knowledge of computer hardware which makes it little difficult to program. For Example C and C++ programming languages.</li>
<li><strong>High-level language</strong>- Its right to say, this level of the programming language is the highest level of the programming language in the technology. These types of programming languages do not require the knowledge of the hardware. This level of the programming language is elementary to learn by the humans. For Example Java, PHP, Perl, Python, etc.</li>

<h3 class="h3">45) Difference between Class and Struct.</h3>
<p>Structures and classes are two distinct concepts in programming, where structures are more limited in functionality and features compared to classes. Classes are composed of related variables and functions that are encapsulated in a single structure, while structures are user-defined datatypes used to process their operations. Declarations for structures utilize the keyword "struct," while "class" is used for classes. The default access specifier for classes is private, whereas for structures, it is public. Classes are mainly used for data abstraction and inheritance, while structures are generally used for grouping data. Structs usually handle small amounts of data, whereas classes handle more extensive data storages.</p>

<h3 class="h3">47) Describe three levels of data abstraction? Which layer is at the user end?</h3>
<p>Here's a possible rephrased version: 

There exist three levels of data abstraction that are important in computer science and database design. These levels are typically referred to as conceptual, logical, and physical. Each level involves a different level of detail and complexity in terms of how data is organized and represented. Understanding these levels is important for developing effective databases and information systems.</p>
<ol class="points">
<li><strong>Physical level:</strong> This is the lowest level of database abstraction describes how the data are stored.</li>
<li><strong>Logical level:</strong> This level is the next higher level than the physical level of database abstraction, which represents the data stored in the database and what relationship among those data.</li>
<li><strong>View level:</strong> This is the highest level of database abstraction describes only part of the entire database.</li>
</ol>
<p>The layer of database abstraction that deals with the view level is situated at the user's end.</p>

<h3 class="h3">48) Difference between 'Macro' and 'ordinary' definition.</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>The difference between a macro and an ordinary definition is that a macro can accept parameters, whereas an ordinary definition cannot.</li>
<li>The value obtained at runtime varies based on the parameters specified in the macro, while the value of a regular definition remains constant throughout the runtime.</li>
<li>One can use macros to perform operations conditionally, whereas a definition cannot.</li>
<li>In C programming, macros serve as a means to achieve functionality that can be included inline. In other words, macros enable us to define a function that performs basic operations. This feature cannot be realized through definitions.</li>

<h3 class="h3">51) What is the difference and similarity between C and C++?</h3>
<p>C++ is a programming language that builds upon and extends the syntax of C. Both languages utilize the same compilers. However, unlike C, C++ incorporates the use of classes and objects which constitute an important part of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In contrast, C does not utilize OOP concepts such as classes and objects. Therefore, C++ is regarded as an OOP-based programming language, while C is not.</p>

<h3 class="h3">52) What are the different modulation techniques?</h3>
<p>There are two primary styles of modulation techniques, namely analog and digital. Analog modulation can be classified into three categories, which include amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, and phase modulation.</p>

<h3 class="h3">53) Differentiate between 'a' and "a."</h3>
<p>The meaning of "a" differs in C programming language when it is a string value versus when it is a character value, with 'a' being the latter.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">54) What is the pre-processor?</h3>
<p>The pre-processor is a tool that performs text substitution operations. It gives instructions to the compiler to carry out pre-processing tasks before actual compilation.</p>
