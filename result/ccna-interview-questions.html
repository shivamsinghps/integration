<h3 class="h3">3) What are the advantages of using Switches?</h3>
<p><strong>Benefits of utilizing switches:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Switches play a crucial role in the transmission process as they receive signals and convert them into frames containing bits. These signals allow switches to read the destination address and appropriately forward the frame. As a result, switches are essential for gaining access and reading data during transmission.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">4) What is Routing?</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>Routing refers to the act of determining the optimal path for transmitting data between a source and destination.</li>
<li>Routing can be applied to various systems including computer networks and circuit switched networks.</li>
<li>Packet switching networks rely on the process of routing to determine the path that packets should take from their origin to their intended destination. This involves making a decision about the most efficient route to take based on the network topology and other factors.</li>
<li>The process of routing involves relying on a routing table that keeps track of the paths to different destinations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types of routing:</strong></p>
<ol class="points">
<li><strong>Static routing</strong>: Static routing is a routing technique where an administrator manually adds the routes in a routing table. Static routes are used when the route selections are limited. Static routes can also be used in those situations where the devices are fewer and no need to change in the route configuration in future.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic routing</strong>: Dynamic routing is a routing technique where protocols automatically update the information of a routing table.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">5) What are Routers?</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>Routers are responsible for performing the routing process and act as devices at the network layer level.</li>
<li>A router is an essential networking tool that can be connected through cables or wirelessly. It facilitates the transmission of data over various networks.</li>
<li>The process of routing packets involves routers analyzing headers and referencing routing tables to identify the most efficient path for the packets to follow.</li>
<li>The router is responsible for examining the information that is transmitted through the network, adjusting its format, and forwarding it to its intended destination.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here are some examples of what routers are:</strong></p>
<ol class="points">
<li><strong>Brouter</strong>: Brouter stands for "Bridge Router". It serves both as a router and bridge.</li>
<li><strong>Core router</strong>: Core router is a router in the computer network that routes the data within a network, but not between the networks.</li>
<li><strong>Edge router</strong>: An edge router is a router that resides at the boundary of a network.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual router</strong>: A virtual router is a software-based router. The virtual router performs the packet routing functionality through a software application. A Virtual Router Redundancy protocol implements the virtual router to increase the reliability of the network.</li>
<li><strong>Wireless router</strong>: A wireless router is a router that connects the local networks with another local network.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">6) What is the advantage of VLAN?</h3>
<p>A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is a network configuration that is composed of one or more existing LANs. This type of network allows users to create a collision domain based on groups, rather than physical location. In contrast, traditional LANs are limited to specific physical locations.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/advantage-of-vlan.png" alt="CCNA Interview Questions">
<p><strong>Advantage of VLAN:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Broadcast control</strong>: A VLAN (Virtual Area Network) removes the physical layer and, it logically separates the networks within networks creating a smaller broadcast domain. It reduces the size of the broadcast domain, therefore, improving the efficiency of the network.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified administration</strong>: When a computer is moved to another location, but it stays on the same VLAN without any hardware configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>LAN segmentation</strong>: Virtual Area Networks are used to logically separate layer 2 switch networks. Users on different VLAN cannot communicate with each other. Therefore, it's a great way of segmentation and provides security.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic VLANs</strong>: The Dynamic VLAN's are created using the software. The VLAN Management Policy Server (VMPS) is an administrator that dynamically allocates the switch ports based on the information available such as the MAC addresses of the device.</li>
<li><strong>Protocol-based VLANs</strong>: The switch that depends on the protocol based VLANs, then the traffic will be segregated by a particular protocol.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">7) What is HDLC?</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>The HDLC protocol, or High-Level Data Link Control protocol, is a type of encapsulation used by Cisco routers as a standard. This protocol is unique to Cisco and is commonly used in data communication networks.</li>
<li>The High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) protocol includes additional data in a data frame that enables devices to manage the flow of data.</li>
<li>The High-level Data Link Control (HDLC) protocol is a bit-oriented communication protocol that allows for both half and full duplex communication.</li>
<li>HDLC provides synchronous data communication with a range of benefits, including adaptability, flexibility, reliability, and efficient operation.</li>
<li>The communication system can support both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint transmissions.</li>
<li>The communication technology provides both synchronous and asynchronous modes of communication.</li>
<li>The system ensures complete transparency of data by delivering output that exactly matches the input, without any limitations on bit sequence.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">8) What are the advantages of LAN switching?</h3>
<p>LAN switching facilitates direct communication between multiple users on a network, offering high-speed connectivity and a collision-free environment.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/advantages-of-lan-switching.png" alt="CCNA Interview Questions">
<p><strong>LAN switching has several benefits, including faster data transmission between devices, reduced network congestion, and enhanced security. With LAN switching, data packets are sent directly to their destination, which helps to reduce bottlenecks and improve network efficiency. Additionally, LAN switching allows for better control over network access, ensuring that only authorized users can access shared resources. Overall, LAN switching can greatly improve the performance and security of local area networks.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Increased network scalability</strong>: LAN switching can handle the increasing amount of work. Therefore, we can say that when the business grows, the network can expand easily.</li>
<li><strong>Improved bandwidth performance</strong>: We require higher bandwidth performance when users operate multimedia applications or some database interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple simultaneous connections</strong>: LAN switching allows multiple simultaneous connections, i.e., it can transfer the multiple data at the same time. This cannot be possible in the case of a hub-based network.</li>
<li><strong>Decreased traffic buildup and a reduction in the time taken for data to travel from one point to another.</strong>: LAN switching improves the performance of a network as a segmented network consists of fewer hosts per subnetwork and thus, minimizing the local traffic.</li>
<li><strong>The absence of any individual component or system that would cause a complete system failure is known as "no single point of failure."</strong>: LAN switching provides the proper network designing. Therefore, there are fewer chances of network failure.</li>
<li><strong>Enables data transmission in both directions simultaneously.</strong>: LAN switching allows full duplex data transmission, i.e., the data can be transferred in a bidirectional line at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">9) What is DLCI?</h3>
<p>DLCI is an abbreviation for Data Link Connection Identifiers. These identifiers are typically allocated by a frame relay service provider to give each virtual circuit a unique identity on the network.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">10) What are the different types of networks?</h3>
<p>There are two primary categories of networks.</p>
<p><strong>1. Peer-to-Peer Network:</strong></p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/types-of-networks.png" alt="CCNA Interview Questions">
<ul class="points">
<li>A peer-to-peer network is comprised of computers that are linked together through an internet connection, and these computers are referred to as 'peers.'</li>
<li>The network's computer systems can function independently without relying on any computer server.</li>
<li>In peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, the computer functions as both a server and a client. This means that it not only receives information from other computers but also shares its own resources with them.</li>
<li>To create a peer-to-peer network, a computer needs two main things: a reliable internet connection and software designed specifically for P2P networking.</li>
<li>There are several popular P2P software peers in the market, including Kazaa, Limewire, BearShare, Morpheus, and Acquisition.</li>
<li>When we are connected to a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, we have the ability to scan for files on other individuals' computers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Peer-to-peer networks can be categorized into various types based on their functionalities, characteristics and capabilities.</strong></p>
<ol class="points">
<li><strong>Pure P2P</strong>: In P2P, peers act as a client and server. There is no central server and central router present in the pure P2P.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid P2P</strong>: Hybrid P2P has a central server that stores the information and responds to the request for that information. Peers are used for hosting the information as a central server does not store the files. Nasper is an example of Hybrid P2P.</li>
<li><strong>Mixed P2P</strong>: Mixed P2P is a combination of pure P2P and Hybrid P2P.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2. Server-based Network</strong></p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/types-of-networks2.png" alt="CCNA Interview Questions">
<ul class="points">
<li>A network that utilizes a central server as the foundation is called a server-based network. The central server serves as the hub for the network.</li>
<li>The main server is responsible for performing various functions like verifying the identity of users, keeping files secure, supervising printing operations, and executing software applications like email and database programs.</li>
<li>In a server-based network, security is concentrated in the centralized system. This allows users to have a single login ID and password to access any computer within the network.</li>
<li>Networks that are server-based are usually more intricate and expensive to set up, and may also require dedicated administration services to keep them running smoothly.</li>
<li>The traffic in server-based networks is mainly focused on communication between the servers.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">11) What is the difference between private IP and public IP?</h3>

<h3 class="h3">22) What is Topology in CCNA?</h3>
<p>The term topology refers to the structure or layout of a computer network. It involves how various components such as links and nodes are arranged in order to achieve efficient data transmission. In CCNA, there are several different types of topology that are commonly used.</p>
<p><strong>Bus:</strong></p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/topology-in-ccna.png" alt="CCNA Interview Questions">
<ul class="points">
<li>A bus topology is a networking arrangement where the nodes are linked via a primary cable referred to as a bus or backbone. All the devices attached to the network only have access to this main communication pathway.</li>
<li>The bus is a communication pathway shared by all devices connected to a computer, allowing them to transmit data to one another. Whenever a device wants to send data to others, it sends this data through the bus, which then distributes it to all connected devices.</li>
<li>The bus topology is effective for networks having only a few devices. However, it comes with a drawback that if the bus becomes damaged, the entire network will be affected and stop functioning properly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Star:</strong></p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/topology-in-ccna2.png" alt="CCNA Interview Questions">
<ul class="points">
<li>A star topology refers to a type of networking structure where a central device is linked to all the nodes within a network. This design ensures that each node only requires a connection to the central device, rather than to multiple nodes.</li>
<li>The star topology is known for its reliability as it only disconnects a single computer connected to a failed cable, while the rest of the network remains operational. However, it requires more cabling than other topologies, making it a less cost-effective option for smaller networks.</li>
<li>In the event of the central device being impaired or dysfunctional, the entire network would cease to operate.</li>
<li>The installation, management, and troubleshooting of a star topology are simple and straightforward.</li>
<li>A frequently used network topology in homes and offices is known as star topology.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ring:</strong></p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/topology-in-ccna3.png" alt="CCNA Interview Questions">
<ul class="points">
<li>A ring topology is a type of network configuration where each node is connected to two or more nodes, forming a continuous path for data transmission. The connections are arranged in a circular shape, allowing for efficient and reliable communication between the nodes.</li>
<li>The system operates without requiring a centralized server to manage the networking between individual nodes.</li>
<li>If there is damage to a particular node in a network, it can cause the entire network to fail.</li>
<li>Ring topology is not a popular choice due to its high cost, installation complexity, and maintenance difficulty.</li>
<li>Instances of a Ring topology include networks like SONET and SDH.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mesh:</strong></p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/topology-in-ccna4.png" alt="CCNA Interview Questions">
<ul class="points">
<li>Mesh topology is a type of network topology that establishes a connection between all nodes present in the network. In this topology, each node has its individual connection with other nodes.</li>
<li>A mesh network does not require a central switch or hub to manage connectivity between its nodes.</li>
<li>Mesh topology is categorized into two parts:
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>A fully connected mesh topology is a type of network topology where all devices or nodes are connected to each other directly, forming a mesh-like structure.</strong>: In this topology, all the nodes are connected to each other.</li>
<li><strong>The partially connected mesh topology refers to a network design where some nodes in the network are only connected to a subset of other nodes in the network, creating a partially interconnected network.</strong>: In this topology, all the nodes are not connected to each other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since only one computer is connected to each cable of a point-to-point cabling arrangement, it is a reliable option in case of cable failure as it will only disconnect the affected computer.</li>
<li>The utilization of mesh topology is infrequent due to complicated installation and configuration procedures that become more challenging as the number of connections increases.</li>
<li>The expense of cabling is significant since it necessitates the use of large amounts of wiring.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tree:</strong></p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/topology-in-ccna5.png" alt="CCNA Interview Questions">
<ul class="points">
<li>The tree topology is a hybrid of the star and bus topologies, and is also referred to as the expanded star topology.</li>
<li>The tree topology consists of several star networks that are linked to a central bus.</li>
<li>The network topology employs the use of Ethernet protocol.</li>
<li>The network is divided into multiple segments, commonly referred to as individual star networks. This segmentation allows for easier maintenance and management. Additionally, in the event that one segment becomes damaged or compromised, it will not have any impact on the other segments.</li>
<li>The functionality of a tree topology is contingent upon the central bus, and in the event of its failure, the entire network will be adversely affected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hybrid:</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>A hybrid topology is formed by combining various topologies to create a new topology with unique characteristics.</li>
<li>If a network topology called star topology is interconnected with another network topology that is also a star topology, it will still maintain its original configuration. However, if the star topology is linked with a different topology, it transforms into a hybrid topology.</li>
<li>The implementation of this system offers versatility since it can be applied in various network settings, providing adaptability to different environments.</li>
<li>The focus is solely on the strengths of the topology, while its weaknesses are disregarded.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">23) What is the passive topology in CCNA?</h3>
<p>Passive topology is a type of network arrangement where computers in the network only have the capability to listen and receive signals. These computers do not amplify signals in any way.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">24) What is RAID in CCNA?</h3>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3"></h3>
<p>RAID is an acronym that stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. It is a technique utilized to establish fault-tolerant disk systems, with varying levels that provide benefits like performance, cost-effectiveness, reliability, and more. The three most common RAID levels are widely implemented.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Level 0: (Striping)</li>
<li>Level 1: (Mirroring)</li>
<li>Level 5 refers to a data storage technique involving striping and parity. This method is used to improve data redundancy and fault tolerance in computer systems. Striping involves distributing data across multiple disks in a way that allows for simultaneous reading and writing. Parity is a method of error correction that involves using an additional bit to store information about the state of the data on each disk. Together, striping and parity help ensure that data can be recovered in the event of disk failure or other errors.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">25) What is the point-to-point protocol in CCNA?</h3>
<p>The point-to-point protocol is an established set of protocols used for sending data packets over a point-to-point link. This protocol is designed for use in Wide Area Networks (WANs) and operates at the second layer of the network stack. It provides encapsulation for frames to ensure efficient data transmission over the physical layer.</p>
<p><strong>The point-to-point protocol offers several features including...</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Link quality management</strong>: It is a technique to monitor the quality of a link. If it finds any error in a link, then the link is shut down.</li>
<li>The point-to-point protocol offers a feature for authentication to ensure secure network communication.</li>
<li>The protocol layer of OSPF is vital to the functioning of internet networks. Its key functions are to ensure secure access, detect errors, monitor link quality, maintain balanced load, and compress data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here's a possible rephrased version:

The point-to-point protocol consists of several components.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Encapsulation</strong>: Point-to-point protocol encapsulates the network packets in its frames using HDLC protocol. This makes the PPP layer three layer independent.</li>
<li><strong>Link Control Protocol</strong>: Link Control Protocol is used for establishing, configuring and testing the data link over internet connections.</li>
<li><strong>Network Control Protocol</strong>: Point-to-point protocol is used in a data link layer in the OSI reference model. The data comes from the upper layer, i.e., transport layer or network layer is fully compatible with PPP due to the presence of a Network control protocol.</li>

<h3 class="h3">26) What are the possible ways of data transmission in CCNA?</h3>
<p>Simplex, half-duplex, and full-duplex are essentially different modes through which information can be exchanged between two communicating parties over a channel. The channel could be a physical medium like cables, fiber optics, etc., or it could be a logical medium like wireless communication.</p>
<p>There are three methods for transmitting data.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/possible-ways-of-data-transmission.png" alt="CCNA Interview Questions">
<p><strong>Simplex</strong></p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/possible-ways-of-data-transmission2.png" alt="CCNA Interview Questions">
<ul class="points">
<li>In simplex communication, data is transmitted in only one direction.</li>
<li>A simplex communication channel is exemplified by a radio station, where the transmission of signals is done in one direction only, from the station to the receiver. In this scenario, the radio station sends out signals while the receiver merely listens or receives the signals.</li>
<li>Simplex mode allows for the full utilization of bandwidth during data transmission, as data can flow in only one direction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Half-duplex</strong></p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/possible-ways-of-data-transmission3.png" alt="CCNA Interview Questions">
<ul class="points">
<li>In a half-duplex communication channel, information can be sent in both directions, but not simultaneously.</li>
<li>Compared to simplex communication channels, half-duplex has a superior performance because it allows data to be transmitted in both directions.</li>
<li>A common example of a half-duplex communication channel is the "walkie-talkie". This device allows both the sender and receiver to communicate with each other on the same channel at different times, but not simultaneously.</li>
<li>When using half-duplex mode, the transmitter is able to utilize the entire bandwidth of the communication channel during message transmission.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Full-duplex</strong></p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/possible-ways-of-data-transmission4.png" alt="CCNA Interview Questions">
<ul class="points">
<li>A communication channel that enables the transmission of information in both directions simultaneously is known as full-duplex communication.</li>
<li>Full-duplex communication channels outperform half-duplex channels due to their ability to simultaneously process data in both directions.</li>
<li>An illustration of a communication channel that facilitates two-way communication is the telephone. The telephone permits individuals to talk and listen simultaneously, making communication more effective.</li>
