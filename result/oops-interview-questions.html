<h1 class="h1">OOPs Interview Questions</h1>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a programming technique that emphasizes the use of objects, rather than just functions and procedures. OOPs is widely regarded as the most popular programming paradigm among developers.</p>
<p>In today's tech industry, companies are seeking and recruiting individuals who possess proficiency in object-oriented techniques and models. These companies also incorporate interviews that aim to evaluate a candidate's understanding of OOPs. Hiring candidates knowledgeable in OOPs offers the advantage of being able to adapt and learn new OOP languages per the organization's needs. Familiarizing oneself with OOP interview questions can ultimately increase the likelihood of being hired.</p>
<p>Here are some frequently asked questions about OOPs that can help you prepare for your interview, whether you're a new graduate or an experienced professional. This collection of questions covers a variety of topics related to OOPs, allowing you to boost your chances of landing your dream job.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/oops-interview-questions.png" alt="OOPs Interview Questions">
<h3 class="h3">1) What do you understand by OOP?</h3>
<p>Object-oriented programming, commonly referred to as OOP, is a programming style that centers around the use of objects, contrary to traditional approaches that focus on functions and procedures. OOP prioritizes the incorporation of objects to create an application. These objects are tangible entities consisting of specific data and code, which make it possible to merge the two.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">2) Name any seven widely used OOP languages.</h3>
<p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is used in several different programming languages. However, some languages are more popularly used for OOP than others.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Python</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Go</li>
<li>Dart</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">3) What is the purpose of using OOPs concepts?</h3>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is designed to replicate real-life objects such as heredity, encapsulation and polymorphism within computer programs. The primary objective of OOP is to merge data with the functions that perform operations on them, creating a secure environment that restricts access to this data from other parts of the code, except for the designated function.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">4) What are the four main features of OOPs?</h3>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) consists of four key characteristics which include:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Encapsulation</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
<li>Data Abstraction</li>
</ul>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/oops-interview-questions-q4.png" alt="OOPs Interview Questions">
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">5) Why OOP is so popular?</h3>
<p>The OOPs programming paradigm is widely considered to be a superior approach to programming. It enables developers to write complex code more easily and manage it more effectively. This is largely due to the core principles of OOPs - Data Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism - which provide a framework for solving complex programming problems. As a result of these advantages, OOPs has become a highly popular choice among programmers.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">6) What are the advantages and disadvantages of OOP?</h3>
<p><strong>Advantages of OOP</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The methodology being implemented in this process is a bottom-up approach.</li>
<li>The simulation accurately reflects reality.</li>
<li>Code reusability is a key feature of software development that enables the reuse of code.</li>
<li>The use of abstraction in a system can prevent the unnecessary exposure of data to users, enhancing the system's privacy and security.</li>
<li>In object-oriented programming (OOP), the design phase is thorough and lengthy, resulting in better design and fewer issues. OOP places a strong emphasis on designing the system before implementing it, which helps to ensure that the design is well-thought-out and efficient. As a result, OOP designers are forced to spend more time planning before production, leading to a more refined and reliable end product.</li>
<li>Break down a complicated issue into more manageable components.</li>
<li>Programmers can achieve their objectives more quickly.</li>
<li>Minimizes the complexity.</li>
<li>Make modification and expansion to existing code in a way that does not impact its other features or capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages of OOP</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Effective preparation is essential.</li>
<li>Crafting an effective program can be challenging.</li>
<li>A programmer needs to possess adequate proficiency in their skills.</li>
<li>Classes are sometimes too broad and not specific enough to meet all individual needs.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">7) What are the limitations of OOPs?</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>Thorough testing procedures are necessary to ensure the quality of the product.</li>
<li>Compared to Procedure Oriented Programming, problem-solving using Object Oriented Programming takes a longer time.</li>
<li>One possible disadvantage of using an object-oriented programming approach is that program size may increase compared to programs written using the procedure-oriented approach.</li>
<li>The development of software using the design thinking approach necessitates significant upfront preparation and strategizing.</li>
<li>Comprehension of OOP code can be challenging without access to its relevant class documentation.</li>
<li>At times, these software applications have a tendency to use up a considerable amount of memory.</li>
<li>Inappropriate for minor issues.</li>
<li>It requires a greater amount of time to effectively find solutions to problems.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3">9) What do you understand by pure object-oriented language? Why Java is not a pure object-oriented programming language?</h3>
<p>A programming language that is considered a pure object-oriented language treats everything within the program as an object. This means that there is no support for primitive types. In order for a language to be considered pure object-oriented, it must adhere to certain requirements, such as treating everything as objects.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Encapsulation</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
<li>Abstraction</li>
<li>All the types that are pre-defined within a programming language are considered to be objects.</li>
<li>Every custom-made category in programming is considered an object.</li>
<li>The only way to perform operations on objects is through the use of methods that are accessible to the objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the world of programming, Java is sometimes not considered a pure object-oriented language. This is because certain data types in Java are not handled as objects, resulting in a deviation from true object-oriented principles. Therefore, Java may not be considered a fully object-oriented language by some experts.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">10) What do you understand by class and object? Also, give example.</h3>
<p>A class is a definition or model of an object that is created by users. It is a type of data that can be used to define variables, constants, member functions and other features. Unlike a data structure, it is not meant to consume memory at runtime. Essentially, a class is a logical construct that binds data together and provides a framework for its functionality.</p>
<p>An object refers to a tangible or intangible thing with unique characteristics, properties, and actions that differentiate it from other similar things. It is also known as a specific instance of a class in programming languages. Objects contain variables and functions that are defined within the class and take up memory space. They exhibit different behaviors and states, depending on their attributes and properties.</p>
<p>The image below provides a clear representation of a class and object.</p>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">13) What is the concept of access specifiers when should we use these? </h3>
<p>In object-oriented programming (OOP), developers use access specifiers to define the accessibility of different parts of a class, such as its methods and members. Access specifiers, which are often called access modifiers, refer to keywords like public, private, and protected that set these different accessibility levels. Some programming languages may have additional access specifiers not found in others. These access specifiers are important because they help us to achieve one of the core principles of OOP: encapsulation. The table below provides an overview of the different accessibility levels.</p>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">14) What are the manipulators in OOP and how it works?</h3>
<p>Manipulators are functions that assist in modifying the input or output stream by using insertion and extraction operators. These operators do not change the variables' values. There are two types of manipulators: those with arguments and those without.</p>
<p>Manipulators are used to change the formatting and behavior of output streams in C++. There are various types of manipulators, including those without arguments such as endl, ws, and flush. Manipulators that require an argument include setw(val), setfill(c), setbase(val), and setiosflags(flag). Additionally, there are other manipulators like showpos, fixed, scientific, hex, dec, and oct that can be used in C++.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">15) What are the rules for creating a constructor?</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>It is impossible for a constructor to have a return type.</li>
<li>The name of the constructor should correspond to the name of its class.</li>
<li>The function or method in question cannot be designated as static.</li>
<li>This text cannot be used verbatim as it is considered plagiarism. Here's a possible rephrasing: "It is not possible to designate it as an abstract entity."</li>
<li>The function or feature in question cannot be altered or overwritten.</li>
<li>It cannot be considered as the ultimate conclusion.</li>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">19) What are the characteristics of an abstract class?</h3>
<p>An abstract class is a type of class that is defined with the "abstract" keyword in its declaration. Such a class cannot be created on its own and is intended to be used as a base for other classes. Abstract classes have specific properties that distinguish them from normal classes.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>You cannot create objects of an abstract class, as it is intended to be inherited and extended by derived classes.</li>
<li>An abstract class is capable of containing both abstract and non-abstract methods.</li>
<li>To qualify as an abstract class, it is mandatory that the class has at least one method which is abstract.</li>
<li>An abstract class must contain at least one abstract method, which means it cannot include a full implementation of the method and must be overridden by any concrete subclass that extends the abstract class.</li>
<li>The information is available to anyone and not kept private.</li>
<li>It is declared using the <strong>abstract</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>An abstract class is created with the intention of serving as a shared definition of a base class for multiple derived classes.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">20) Is it possible for a class to inherit the constructor of its base class?</h3>
<p>It is not possible for a class to obtain the constructor of its parent class through inheritance.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">21) Identify which OOPs concept should be used in the following scenario?</h3>
<p><strong>In a group of five friends, there's one boy who never chips in when the group goes out. However, when a stunning girl joins their group, the guy who never used to pay suddenly starts contributing a lot of money for the group's outings.</strong></p>
<p>Runtime Polymorphism</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">22) What is composition?</h3>
<p>Composition is a significant aspect of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that involves a class making references to one or more objects belonging to other classes through instance variables. This modeling technique enables the creation of associations between objects, reflecting real-world relationships. For instance, a car has an engine, which exemplifies a has-a relationship.

<h3 class="h3">23) What are the differences between copy constructor and assignment operator?</h3>
<p>Both the copy constructor and the assignment operator (=) are utilized for initializing one object with the attributes of another object. However, the copy constructor creates a new memory block for both the existing and newly created objects, while the assignment operator doesn't. Instead, it makes use of the reference variable that connects to the previous memory block where the original object is located.</p>
<p><strong>Sure, here's a rephrased version:

The syntax of a copy constructor refers to the way that a copy constructor is written or defined. It determines how objects are copied from one instance to another in a class. The syntax can include the signature of the copy constructor, the list of parameters, and the body of the constructor function. It is a crucial part of object-oriented programming, as it allows for the creation of new objects based on existing instances, simplifying the process of code reuse and aggregation.</strong></p>

<h3 class="h3">24) What is the difference between Composition and Inheritance?</h3>
<p>In software development, two common ways to create relationships between objects are inheritance and composition. Inheritance involves an object inheriting properties of a base class, while composition involves an object holding other objects. In inheritance, only one object exists in memory (the derived object), while in composition, the parent object holds references to all composed objects. In terms of design, inheritance represents an "is a" relationship among objects, while composition represents a "has a" relationship.</p>

<h3 class="h3">25) What is constructor chaining?</h3>
<p>Constructor chaining is a way of initializing an object by invoking a sequence of constructors within a class. It is used when we need to invoke multiple constructors using a single instance. Essentially, if a class has multiple constructors, one of which tries to invoke another constructor, this process is called constructor chaining. This feature is also known as constructor delegation in C++, and it has been present since C++ 11.</p>

<h3 class="h3">26) What are the limitations of inheritance?</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li>Inheritance has a significant drawback of creating tight coupling between two classes, meaning they cannot be used independently of one another. Thus, if a method or aggregate is removed from the Super Class, the SubClass must be refactored to account for this change.</li>
<li>Functions that are inherited from a parent object take longer to execute compared to regular functions.</li>
<li>Proper implementation is crucial when dealing with this issue as wrong approaches can result in incorrect solutions.</li>

<h3 class="h3">28) What is Coupling in OOP and why it is helpful?</h3>
<p>"Separation of concerns" is a programming concept that relates to the degree of connection between objects. It refers to the idea that objects shouldn't directly alter the state or functionality of other objects. This principle is known as coupling. There exist two types of coupling - loose and tight, which determine the extent to which objects are interdependent.</p>
<p>Loose coupling refers to objects that are not tightly dependent on one another and do not directly alter each other's state. When code is loosely coupled, it is more adaptable, modifiable, and simpler to manage.</p>
<p>Tightly coupled objects are objects that rely on each other and can make changes to the states of other objects. This kind of coupling makes it challenging to modify one object's code without also modifying the code of other related objects. Because the code cannot be separated, reusing this code can also be problematic.</p>
<p>It is considered a good practice to implement loose coupling in software development.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">29) Name the operators that cannot be overload.</h3>
<ol class="points">
<li>Could you please provide the original content for me to rephrase it?</li>
<li>Reword the following information to avoid committing plagiarism:

Definition of the Ternary Operator (? :):
The ternary operator (? :) is a conditional operator in programming languages that takes three operands and evaluates a boolean expression. It is a shorthand notation for an if-else statement that can be used to assign values to variables. The first operand is the boolean expression, followed by a question mark (?), a value to be assigned if the expression is true, then a colon (:) and a value to be assigned if it is false.</li>
<li>"Member Access" or "Dot Operator" refers to the use of a period (.) in computer programming languages to access the properties or methods of an object.</li>
<li>One possible rephrased version of the original content could be:

The pointer-to-member operator (.*) is a C++ syntax construct that allows programmers to access data members and methods of an object through a pointer. Using this operator, a pointer to a member function or variable can be declared and used to call the corresponding function or variable on a given object instance. This feature is one of the key benefits of C++ as an object-oriented programming language, as it enables greater flexibility and modularity in code design and implementation.</li>
<li>sizeof operator</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">30) What is the difference between new and override?</h3>
<p>The "new" modifier tells the compiler to use a new implementation of a function instead of the one in the base class. On the other hand, the "override" modifier allows a function in a subclass to take precedence over the function with the same name in the parent class.</p>
<p>"Virtual" refers to a method within a class that can be modified by an inheriting class.</p>
<p>The term "override" refers to the capability of changing the behavior of a virtual method in a base class by providing a different implementation with modified functionality.</p>
<p>The "new" keyword can be used to conceal the original method (even if it's not virtual) and replace it with a different implementation. However, it's recommended to use "new" only when it's essential.</p>
<p>When you conceal a method, it is still possible to reach the original method by utilizing a base class upcast. While this can be beneficial in some situations, it can also be risky.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">31) Explain overloading and overriding with example?</h3>
<p><strong>Overloading</strong></p>
<p>Overloading is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming, which involves having two or more methods in a class with the same name, but the method signature is different. This concept is also known as compile-time polymorphism. A good example is the method "add()" in a class, which can be overloaded.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">public class Sum
{
int a, b, c;
public int add();
{
c=a+b;
return c;
}
add(int a, int b);
{
//logic
}
add(int a, int b, int c);
{
//logic
}
add(double a, double b, double c);
{
//logic
}
//statements
}
</textarea></div>
<br>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/oops-interview-questions-q31.png" alt="OOPs Interview Questions">
<p><strong>Overriding</strong></p>
<p>Method overriding occurs when a subclass implements a method with the same method signature as the parent class. In order for the method to qualify as an override, it must have the same number and type of parameters as the parent class method. The value of the parent class method is then overridden by the subclass method. Method overriding is also referred to as runtime polymorphism. An example code snippet demonstrating method overriding can be seen below.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class Dog
{
public void bark()
{
System.out.println("woof ");
}
}
class Hound extends Dog
{
public void sniff()
{
System.out.println("sniff ");
}
//overrides the method bark() of the Dog class
public void bark()
{
System.out.println("bowl");
}
}
public class OverridingExample
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
Dog dog = new Hound();
//invokes the bark() method of the Hound class
dog.bark();
}
}
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">32) What is Cohesion in OOP?</h3>
<p>Cohesion is a key principle in object-oriented programming. It refers to how well the various elements within a module relate to each other. In essence, it measures the extent to which a module and its data are closely linked. A highly cohesive module is one in which each element has a clear and distinct role. This concept is often compared to coupling, which refers to the degree to which modules depend on each other.</p>
<p>The goal of object-oriented design is to create modules or classes that are highly cohesive. A high level of cohesion indicates good design.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/oops-interview-questions-q32.png" alt="OOPs Interview Questions">
<p>Cohesion can be classified into two categories: High and Low.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>High cohesion is associated with several required qualities of software including <strong>robustness, reliability</strong>, and <strong>understandability</strong>.</li>
<li>Low cohesion is associated with unwanted qualities such as being difficult to <strong>maintain, test, reuse,</strong> or even <strong>understand</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>High cohesion is frequently linked to a situation where there is minimal interdependence between the different components of a system. Similarly, a condition of loose coupling commonly corresponds with high cohesion.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">33) Give a real-world example of polymorphism?</h3>
<p>Polymorphism refers to having various forms. A person who plays different roles in different places or situations is the most applicable real-life example of polymorphism.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>An individual has the ability to fulfill different roles when they are at home, such as being a father, husband, and son.</li>
<li>Within the workplace, an individual may fulfill both the role of a superior or a subordinate.</li>
<li>He assumes the position of a commuter while using public transportation.</li>
<li>One could assume different roles while in a hospital setting, such as acting as a patient or a doctor.</li>
<li>While at the store, he takes on the part of a consumer.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/oops-interview-questions-q33.png" alt="OOPs Interview Questions">
<p>Polymorphism is a phenomenon where a person exhibits different behaviors in different situations. This means that individuals possess varying characteristics and can adapt and respond differently to different conditions or environments.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">34) What is the difference between a base class and a superclass?</h3>
<p>The base class is considered the primary or main class, while the superclass is the immediate parent class that other classes inherit from. The base class is typically the most general and basic class in a hierarchy of classes.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">35) What is data abstraction and how can we achieve data abstraction?</h3>
<p>Abstraction is a key aspect of OOP that helps to keep the details of an implementation hidden from the user, while displaying only crucial information. For instance, when driving a car, we don't need to have knowledge of the internal workings of the engine. We only need to know how to operate the car's controls.</p>
<p>There are a couple of methods to attain data abstraction.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Abstract class</li>
<li>Abstract method</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">36) What are the levels of data abstraction?</h3>
<p>There exist three different levels of data abstraction:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Physical Level:</strong> It is the lowest level of data abstraction. It shows how the data is actually stored in memory.</li>
<li><strong>Logical Level:</strong> It includes the information that is actually stored in the database in the form of tables. It also stores the relationship among the data entities in relatively simple structures. At this level, the information available to the user at the view level is unknown.</li>
<li><strong>View Level:</strong> It is the highest level of data abstraction. The actual database is visible to the user. It exists to ease the availability of the database by an individual user.</li>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/oops-interview-questions-q36.png" alt="OOPs Interview Questions">
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">37) What are the types of variables in OOP?</h3>
<p>There exist three classifications or categories of variables.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/oops-interview-questions-q37.png" alt="OOPs Interview Questions">
<p>An instance variable is a variable that belongs to an object and is defined at the class level. It is declared within the class but outside of any method or constructor. It is created when an instance of the class is created, and it can be accessed directly within the class by referring to its variable name.</p>
<p>A static variable is a type of variable that is defined at the class level and is declared using the keyword "static". It should be placed outside of any constructor, method, or block and is stored in static memory. Its accessibility is similar to that of an instance variable, and it has the same default value. You can access a static variable by referencing the class name followed by the variable name, like "class_name.variable_name."</p>
<p>A local variable is a type of variable that is declared at the method, constructor, or block level. It is not permitted to use an access modifier with local variables. The variable is only visible to the method, block, or constructor in which it is declared and it is implemented at the stack level. Before the variable can be used, it must be declared and initialized.</p>
<p>In object-oriented programming, there is another category of variable known as a reference variable.</p>
<p>A reference variable is a programming variable that holds the memory address or location of an object in the program's memory. Essentially, instead of holding the actual object, it holds a reference or pointer to the object's location. It is commonly used in object-oriented programming languages.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">38) Is it possible to overload a constructor?</h3>
<p>Certainly, let me rephrase it for you. Overloading constructors is possible in Java by adjusting the number of arguments accepted or changing the data type of the parameters. For illustration:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">public class Demo
{
Demo()
{
//logic
}
Demo(String str) //overloaded constructor 
{
//logic
}
Demo(double d) //overloaded constructor
{
//logic
}
//statements
}
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">39) Can we overload the main() method in Java also give an example?</h3>
<p>Certainly, would you like a paraphrasing of the entire content or just certain parts of it?</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class OverloadMain  
{  
public static void main(int a)  //overloaded main method  
{  
System.out.println(a);  
}  
public static void main(String args[])  
{     
System.out.println("main method invoked");  
main(6);  
}  
}  
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">40) Consider the following scenario: </h3>
<p><strong>Reworded: Consider a hypothetical class called Demo that contains both a static block and a main() method, each including a print statement. One may wonder which of the two will execute first. Can you explain why this is the case?</strong></p>
<p>The JVM gives high priority to the execution of the static block in a program. This means that the static block is executed before the main() method is looked for and executed.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">class Demo  
{  
static                  //static block  
{  
System.out.println("Static block");  
}  
public static void main(String args[])  //static method  
{  
System.out.println("Static method");  
}  
}
