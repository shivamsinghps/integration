<h1 class="h1">Most Asked Finance Interview Questions</h1>
<p>Here's an example of a revised version:

You may encounter these common Finance Interview questions when preparing for your job interview. Below are some possible answers to help you feel more confident and prepared.</p>
<h3 class="h3">1) What are the two main categories of finance interview questions?</h3>
<p>The following are the two major types of finance interview questions that you may encounter during the hiring process for a financial analyst position:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Behavioral/fit questions:</strong> These questions mainly focus on soft skills such as your ability to work with a team, leadership, commitment, creative thinking, and your overall personality type. For these types of questions, you can pick some examples of specific situations from your resume that you can use as examples of leadership, teamwork, smartness, weakness, hard work, problem-solving, etc. You can also refer to our most asked set of behavioral interview questions: <a href="behavioral-interview-questions.html">https://www.javatpoint.com/behavioral-interview-questions</a></li>
<li><strong>Technical questions:</strong> These types of questions are related to specific accounting and finance topics.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">2) What are the three main financial statements? </h3>
<p>The three primary financial statements include:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> The balance sheet is used to show the company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. In other words, we can say that it shows what the owner owns, what it owes, and its net worth.</li>
<li><strong>Income statement:</strong> The income statement is used to specify its revenues, expenses, and net income.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow Statement:</strong> The cash flow statement is used to specify cash inflows and outflows from three areas: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">3) Which statement would you use and why if you are limited to choosing only one statement to review a company's overall health?</h3>
<p>If we had to choose only one statement to assess a company's overall health, it would be advisable to use the cash flow statement. This is because cash flow is crucial to an organization's financial stability, and the statement presents an accurate picture of how much cash the business generates. While this is a subjective question, an appropriate response would be one that provides a strong justification. One might argue, for example, that the balance sheet is the preferable choice because assets are the primary drivers of cash flow. Another option might be to select the income statement as it demonstrates the company's earning power and profitability.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">4) What should be an ideal company's budgeting process look like? </h3>
<p>A suitable budget for a business is one that is feasible, tailored to success, and encompasses contingency planning. It must be closely aligned with the company's overall strategic objectives and involve input from all departments through an iterative process. Depending on the type of business in question, the budget may either be based on the previous year or developed from scratch. A well-structured budgeting and planning timetable that is easily followed by everyone is crucial for success.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">5) What is the full form of WACC? How can you calculate it? </h3>
<p>The WACC, or Weighted Average Cost of Capital, a financial metric used in capital budgeting, is computed by taking into account the proportion of debt to total capital. This proportion is then multiplied by the interest rate on the debt, then multiplied again by one minus the effective tax rate. Also factored in is the percentage of equity to capital which is multiplied by the required return on equity.</p>
<img src="/Assets/interview/images/finance-interview-questions-q5.png" alt="Finance Interview Questions">
<ul class="points">
<li>WACC stands for the weighted average cost of capital.</li>
<li>This statement refers to the total number of sources of financing or capital available to a company. These sources may include securities and various types of liabilities.</li>
<li>The "r_i" refers to the rate of return that a particular security needs to provide in order to meet the expected return of an investor.</li>
<li>i = security</li>
<li>The market value of all outstanding securities is represented by the acronym MV_i.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">6) What is the difference between Audit and Review?</h3>
<p>In the finance industry, there are two common terms used: Audit and Review. While these terms are often used interchangeably, they actually refer to two distinct services provided by CPA firms when verifying or examining a company's financial statements. The primary differences between these terms relate to the type of service provided.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>An audit is an impartial and authorized investigation and validation of a company's financial records, statements, inventory, operations, etc. Conversely, a review is a formal evaluation of financial statements that involves making any necessary modifications.</li>
<li>A review is a less costly alternative to an audit, making it a more viable choice for new or developing companies with limited financial resources.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">7) When should a company issue debt instead of equity? </h3>
<p>A crucial aspect for any business is to ensure that its capital structure is optimized. One effective strategy is for the company to take advantage of tax benefits by issuing debt when it has a taxable income. However, it is essential to ensure that the company's cash flows are stable enough to make the necessary interest payments. By issuing debt in such circumstances, businesses can lower their weighted average cost of capital and improve their financial performance.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">8) Which is cheaper between debt and equity? </h3>
<p>Debt financing has certain advantages over equity financing, as it has a lower cost and is paid before equity, with collateral to back it up. This makes debt a preferred choice for businesses in the event of liquidation. However, businesses must weigh the benefits and drawbacks of debt and equity financing before making a decision.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">9) What do you understand by the term working capital?</h3>
<p>Working capital refers to the total current assets minus current liabilities of a company. Essentially, this represents the amount of money readily available to an organization to sustain its daily operations.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">10) What do you understand by goodwill? Why is it used?</h3>
<p>Goodwill is an intangible asset that arises during the acquisition of one company by another. Essentially, it represents the excess value of the cost price over the essential market value. This category of assets is intangible and exceeds the sum of the fair value of all the acquired assets and the liabilities assumed during the acquisition process.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">11) What do you understand by negative working capital? </h3>
<p>Negative working capital is a commonly used financial strategy in certain industries such as grocery retail and restaurants. In these industries, customers pay for their purchases upfront, while suppliers typically offer a 30-day credit term. This cash inflow event can create a cash surplus that a company can use to finance other operations. Negative working capital can be a sign of efficiency in businesses with low inventory and accounts receivable. However, it can also indicate financial distress if a company doesn't have enough cash to meet its current liabilities, such as paying suppliers and fulfilling orders.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">12) When do you capitalize rather than expense a purchase?</h3>
<p>When a business purchases assets that will be used for more than a year, the cost is recorded as an investment and is depreciated over time based on the company's accounting practices.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">13) Is it possible for a company to show positive cash flows but be in grave trouble? </h3>
<p>Certainly. There are cases where a company can exhibit optimistic cash flows but still face financial difficulties. For example, let's take a look at two instances.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Unsustainable enhancements in working capital refer to the actions taken by a company to improve their working capital position through methods that are not viable in the long run, such as selling off inventory or delaying payments to vendors.</li>
<li>One of the challenges faced in moving forward with a project is the issue of insufficient revenue at various stages of its development.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">14) Is it possible for a company to show positive net income but go bankrupt? </h3>
<p>There may be ways for a company to manipulate their financial statements to show better performance than their actual financial situation. This can include tactics such as reducing accounts payable and increasing accounts receivable, as well as engaging in fraudulent behavior.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">15) What do you understand by the term debentures? </h3>
<p>A debenture is a legal agreement document, issued under the company's stamp, that acknowledges the loan given by the debenture holder. The holder of the debenture is entitled to receive a fixed interest rate and the principal amount at the time of maturity.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">16) What do you understand by hedging and preference capital? </h3>
<p>Hedging capital can be used to reduce risks and is similar to the concept of insurance. Another financial term is preference capital, which has priority over equity capital when it comes to dividends and liquidation of the company.</p>
<p>The distinction between these two cities lies in their primary purpose. Whereas one aims to increase profits, the other is focused on managing and reducing risks.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">17) What do you understand by a deferred tax liability?</h3>
<p>A deferred tax liability is created when a company expects to pay taxes to the IRS in the future. It is the opposite of a deferred tax asset.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">18) What do you understand by the term composite cost of capital?</h3>
<p>The composite cost of capital is a crucial metric for businesses when it comes to financing their operations. It is calculated using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which gives an estimate of the overall cost of capital for the company.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">19) Explain the cash flow statement in detail and also specify how it works?</h3>
<p>The cash flow statement is a crucial financial record that details the incoming and outgoing cash in a business. There are two approaches in creating this statement - the direct technique and the indirect technique.</p>
<p>As stated in its annual report, the organization typically employs the direct method when creating its cash flow statement.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Direct Method:</strong> In the direct method, the cash is collected from customers adding interests and dividends and then deducting cash paid to suppliers, interest paid, and income tax paid.</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Method:</strong> In the indirect method, the cash is collected from net income, and then all non-cash charges are added back, which are depreciation and amortization expense. In this method, we also add the working capital changes.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">20) What are the different activities used in the cash flow statement? </h3>
<p>The cash flow statement can be divided into three activities:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>The following is a definition of "Cash Flow from Operations":

The amount of cash a company generates from its normal business operations, such as sales and expenses, is called Cash Flow from Operations. It measures the company's ability to generate cash from its day-to-day business activities.</strong> The activity "Cash Flow from Operations" consists of the cash inflows and outflows generated from the company's core business or product.</li>
<li><strong>Rewritten: The cash flow from investing refers to the amount of money that a company generates or uses in investment activities such as purchasing or selling assets, acquiring other businesses, or purchasing long-term investments. This metric highlights the extent to which a company is investing in its future growth and expansion.</strong> The activity "Cash Flow from Investing" consists of the cash inflows and outflows from a company in the form of investments like purchase or sale of PP&amp;E (property, plant &amp; equipment).</li>
<li><strong>"Cash Flow from Financing" is a term that refers to a section in a company's cash flow statement that shows the movement of cash between the company and its investors. This can include cash received from issuing stocks or bonds, as well as cash paid out for dividends or debt payments. It is an important metric that can provide insights into a company's financial health and its ability to fund its operations.</strong> The activity "Cash Flow from Financing" consists of cash inflows and outflows generated from all the company's financing activities like issuance of Bonds or early retirement of Debt.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">21) If you were the CFO of a company, what would be the top priority that keeps you up at night?</h3>
<p>It's important to be careful while answering a question about a company's financial stability as it requires a diplomatic approach. It's best to provide an overview of the company's current financial status or its position in the industry. Additionally, it's recommended to mention key points from the three financial statements, including the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. Creating a personalized response is crucial to avoid plagiarism.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Income statement:</strong> It consists of the growth rates, margins, and profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Balance sheet:</strong> The liquidity, capital assets, credit metrics, liquidity ratios, leverage, return on assets (ROA), and return on equity (ROE).</li>
<li><strong>Cash flow statement:</strong> The short-term and long-term cash flow profile, any need to raise money or return capital to shareholders.</li>
<li><strong>Non-financial statement:</strong> As a CFO, you should also be aware of company culture, government regulation, and the conditions in the capital markets.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">22) What do you understand by the term adjustment entries?</h3>
<p>Adjustment entries are crucial entries that are made at the end of an accounting period. These entries are necessary as they help to adjust and stabilise nominal and other accounts before the preparation of the final entries. Adjustment entries serve as an essential preliminary step that is taken before the finalisation of the balance sheet.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">23) What do you mean by the term cost accountancy? </h3>
<p>Cost accountancy involves managing and reporting on the costs and profits of a business to ensure fairness and support effective decision-making. It involves many accounting methods to accurately track cost control and other financial data. It is an essential tool to reflect the profitability of a business and make informed management decisions.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">24) If a company purchases a new piece of equipment, then what would be the impact of the purchase on the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows? </h3>
<p>Suppose a company has purchased a new piece of equipment, then at the time of the purchase, there is a cash outflow (cash flow statement), and the balance sheet (PP&amp;E) goes up. Over some time, the asset's life will depreciate, then it shows up a reduction in net income (income statement), and PP&amp;E (balance sheet) decreases by the amount depreciated. At the same time, the retained earnings (balance sheet) also go down. However, the depreciation is added back in cash from the operations section (cash flow statement) as it is a non-cash expense the reduced net income. So, only the balance sheet and cash flow statements are impacted by the purchasing of the equipment. </p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">25) Why would two companies merge? What are the major factors that drive mergers and acquisitions?</h3>
<p>Numerous factors can drive companies to pursue mergers and acquisitions. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>In order to attain cost savings through combined efforts, companies aim to create synergies.</li>
<li>To expand business operations into a previously untapped market.</li>
<li>To acquire fresh methods or processes.</li>
<li>To remove a rival or competitor from the market or industry.</li>
<li>To achieve the necessary financial targets and indicators.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="n">Note: There may also some social reasons, but we have to be careful about mentioning them.</h4>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">26) What do you understand by PP&amp;E? How can you record it, and why is it important?</h3>
<p>PP&amp;E is an acronym that stands for Property, Plant, and Equipment. When it comes to the balance sheet accounting of PP&amp;E, there are four main factors to consider.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The initial purchase</li>
<li>Depreciation</li>
<li>Additions (capital expenditures)</li>
<li>Dispositions</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the four accounting methods mentioned earlier, there is also another method that companies can use to manage their assets, which is revaluation. Plant, property, and equipment (PP&amp;E) are typically the major capital assets that generate revenue, profit, and cash flow for many businesses.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">27) Why are increases in accounts receive a cash reduction on the cash flow statement?</h3>
<p>The first item in the cash flow statement is net income. If there is a rise in accounts receivable, it is viewed as a modification to net income since it demonstrates that the business has not yet received the money owed to them.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">28) How does an inventory write-down affect the three financial statements?</h3>
<p>An inventory write-down has an impact on the three financial statements by altering their respective values.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>When a company writes down the value of its inventory, it results in a decrease in the inventory asset account as well as shareholders' equity on the balance sheet.</li>
<li>If a write-down occurs, it will impact the income statement in the form of an expense, either through a reduction in the cost of goods sold (COGS) or a separate line item for the write-down amount. This will result in a decrease in net income.</li>
<li>The write-down is a non-cash expense that appears on the cash flow statement. To ensure that it is not double-counted in the changes of non-cash working capital, it is added back to cash from operating activities.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">29) How is the income statement linked to the balance sheet? </h3>
<p>The final figure in an income statement is referred to as net income, which has implications for both the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Net income is an essential component for stockholder's equity under retained earnings in the balance sheet.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">30) What do you understand by deferred tax assets, and what can create deferred tax assets? </h3>
<p>A deferred tax asset arises when a business pays more taxes to the IRS than what is reported on their income statement during a specific period.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some possible ways to express the same idea without using the same language as the original:

- A deferred tax asset can arise from several factors, including differences between accounting and tax rules, previous losses or expenses that can be carried forward, and available tax credits.
- When certain conditions are met, a company may have a deferred tax asset on its balance sheet. This can be due to various reasons, such as temporary differences between book and tax income, unused tax benefits from prior periods, or the ability to claim future tax deductions or credits.
- Enterprises may recognize a deferred tax asset in their financial statements if they anticipate a future reduction in tax liabilities. This could be due to factors such as tax losses carried forward, accelerated depreciation, or differences in accounting methods between financial reporting and tax assessment.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Revenue recognition can differ among businesses depending on the types of transactions they engage in. This means that the methods used to account for revenue vary across different industries and even within the same industry.</li>
<li>Expense recognition pertains to the process of identifying and recording expenditures in an organization's financial statements. This may include recognizing costs associated with warranty expenses.</li>
<li>Net operating losses (NOLs) refer to the losses that a company incurs during its business operations, which can be used to offset its taxable income in future years. These losses are typically carried forward for a certain period of time and can provide tax benefits to the company.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3">31) What is the difference between real money and nominal money?</h3>
<p>Real money and nominal money have a fundamental difference. Real money represents its inherent purchasing power, while nominal money is associated with counting or technical enumeration. In simpler terms, nominal money is reflected in bills, while real money stands for actual value.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">32) What is the meaning of treasury bills?</h3>
<p>Treasury bills are financial instruments that the Indian government uses to meet its short-term financial needs. These bills are sold at a discount to their face value and serve as money market instruments. They are not loans, but rather discounted securities that are offered to investors.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">33) What do you understand by short-term financing? </h3>
<p>An organization takes advantage of short-term financing to meet its immediate cash requirements. The borrower must reimburse this type of finance within one year from when it was obtained.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">34) What are the three sources of short-term financing used by a company?</h3>
<p><strong>In general, there are three primary categories of financing sources that offer short-term funding options.</strong></p>
<p>Trade credit is a type of arrangement between a purchaser and vendor of goods whereby the purchaser buys the goods on credit and does not need to pay cash upfront. Instead, the payment is made at a later specified date.</p>
<p>Trade-credit is a payment arrangement that relies on the trust between the buyer and seller. In this method, the buyer receives the goods now, but promises to pay the seller at a later date. It's all based on the mutual understanding that the buyer will settle the cash amount as agreed.</p>
<p>An unsecured bank loan is a type of loan that is offered by banks and is typically paid back within a year. Unlike a secured loan, there is no collateral required for an unsecured bank loan. This type of loan is available to both individuals and business entities.</p>
<p>Bank overdrafts are a form of credit that allows individuals or businesses to withdraw more funds than what is currently available in their checking account. This short-term lending option is provided subject to the bank's regulations, and interest is charged on the amount of the overdraft. In essence, a bank overdraft enables withdrawals beyond the account's balance, and the excess is considered a credit provided by the bank.</p>
<p><strong>There are various other options available for short-term financing sources apart from those mentioned earlier.</strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Commercial Papers</li>
<li>Short-term loans can be secured by providing collateral such as property, vehicles or other assets. This provides lenders with a degree of security and can result in lower interest rates for borrowers. This type of loan is typically used for immediate financial needs and is repaid within a shorter period of time than traditional, long-term loans. The amount that can be borrowed will depend on the value of the collateral provided and the borrower's ability to repay the loan.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">35) What is the difference between the clean and dirty prices of bonds?</h3>
<p><strong>Clean price and dirty price are two terms used in the bond market to refer to the different ways of calculating the bond's value. Clean price is the price of a bond excluding the accrued interest while the dirty price is the price of a bond that includes the accrued interest. Simply put, clean price only takes into account the principal amount of the bond, while dirty price includes both principal and interest.</strong></p>
<p>The clean price of a coupon bond refers to the quoted price that excludes any accrued interest. This means that the clean price doesn't factor in the interest accumulated between the coupon payments. In contrast, the dirty price includes the accrued interest between coupon payments.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">36) What do you understand by the DCF method, and why is it used?</h3>
<p>The DCF method is a technique used to determine the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. It involves projecting future earnings and then discounting them to present value. This valuation method allows investors to estimate the current worth of an investment based on its predicted potential for generating income in the future.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">37) What are the key features of discounted cash flow? </h3>
<p>Here are some key characteristics of the discounted cash flow method:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The method of discounted cash flow is employed to evaluate the worth of an investment by analyzing its forthcoming cash flows.</li>
<li>To determine the present value of projected future cash inflows, a discount rate is applied to compute the discounted cash flow (DCF).</li>
<li>Positive returns can be achieved if the current cost of the investment is lower than the discounted cash flow.</li>
<li>To determine the discount rate, businesses typically utilize the weighted average cost of capital. This approach takes into account the anticipated return rate that shareholders expect to receive.</li>
<li>Discounted cash flow has a major weakness in that it depends heavily on future cash flow projections, which are inherently uncertain. This means that the accuracy of the projections is critical to the reliability of the analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h2padding">The list of general HR questions asked in the Finance interview</h2>
<h3 class="h3">38) Why have you chosen to work in finance?</h3>
<p>Employers often ask candidates about their enjoyment and passion for finance jobs. This is to gauge the candidate's level of interest and enthusiasm for the role. An effective response to this question should showcase the candidate's genuine interest and drive for finance work by highlighting the things they enjoy most about it.</p>
<p>I have decided to pursue a career in finance due to my interest in working with numbers and accounting. I take pleasure in solving financial equations as they offer a definitive solution while accommodating multiple problem-solving approaches.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">39) What are your financial strengths and weaknesses?</h3>
<p>Responding to a question about strengths and weaknesses during a finance job interview can be a difficult task. It is crucial for candidates to identify their skills and challenges in this profession. Honesty is highly regarded when answering this question. Candidates should emphasize their strong points and tactfully address their weak areas.</p>
<p>I am confident that my greatest asset in financial management is my ability to effectively budget. I enjoy utilizing different budgeting techniques to create precise financial forecasts. However, I acknowledge that my weakness may lie in being inconsistent at times.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">40) What is the greatest achievement in your financial career so far? </h3>
<p>To impress the hiring manager and showcase your capabilities, it's important to elaborate on your most significant accomplishment. This demonstrates an understanding of your achievements and highlights your worth as a candidate for the position.</p>
<p>My most significant success in my career as a finance planner was assisting a client in eliminating a substantial amount of debt (with a specific figure) in just two years and ensuring their financial stability in the long run. It brings me immense satisfaction to know that my expertise has the potential to positively impact people's lives.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">41) What are the short-term financing you can suggest if our company needs immediate cash? </h3>
<p>The interviewer seeks to determine if you have the skills to handle a financial crisis that any business may face. They want to know whether you have a plan in place to address current liabilities and how well you can identify and resolve financial problems. Additionally, this question evaluates your level of experience in finance.</p>
<p>A potential answer: If the company needs a quick injection of funds, my recommendation would be to explore options such as trade credit, bank loans, or a bank overdraft. I believe these would be the most effective ways to address the immediate cash needs. Additionally, it would be crucial to conduct a thorough analysis of all financial statements to prevent similar cash flow issues in the future.</p>
