<p>The deployment of Microservices typically involves several strategies to ensure successful implementation.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>One possible way to rephrase the content could be: 

"Having multiple service instances on a single host is a common practice in modern computing. Instead of dedicating a separate host for each service, having multiple instances can help reduce hardware costs and increase resource utilization. However, proper load-balancing and performance monitoring are essential to ensure that the host can handle all the service instances effectively and efficiently."</strong> It is used to run single or multiple service instances of the application on a single or multiple physical/virtual hosts.</li>
<li><strong>One approach to managing services in a network is to assign a separate service instance to each host. This means that each host on the network has its own instance of the service, which can help to distribute the load and improve performance.</strong> It is used to run a service instance per host.</li>
<li>The concept of Service Instance per Container refers to the practice of running each service instance in its own separate container. This approach ensures that there is a clear separation of concerns between different services, and each instance of a service operates independently.</li>
<li><strong>Serverless Deployment:</strong> It packages the service as a ZIP file and uploads it to the Lambda function. The Lambda function is a stateless service that automatically runs enough micro-services to handle all requests.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">16) What are the three types of tests used in Microservices? </h3>
<p>Tests in Microservice architecture can be classified into three primary types.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Bottom Level Test:</strong> The bottom-level tests perform general tests such as performance tests and unit tests. These kinds of tests are entirely automated.</li>
<li><strong>Middle-Level Tests:</strong> The middle-level tests are used to perform exploratory tests such as the stress test and usability test.</li>
<li><strong>Top Level Tests:</strong> The top-level tests are used to conduct acceptance tests, mostly fewer in numbers. These types of tests make stakeholders know about different software features.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">17) What is the main difference between SOA and the Microservices Architecture?</h3>
<p>SOA or Service Oriented Architecture refers to a set of services that interact with each other through activity coordination or data passing. Meanwhile, Microservices Architecture is composed of small, independently deployable modules that are scalable and designed to fulfill specific business objectives. These modules communicate using standard protocols.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">18) What is a Client certificate? What is its usage?</h3>
<p>A client certificate is a type of digital certificate that allows secure and authenticated requests to be made to a remote server. Each microservice is issued with its own unique certificate.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">19) What do you understand by Domain-Driven Design?</h3>
<p>Domain-Driven Design is an architecture approach that uses the concepts and principles of Object-Oriented Analysis and Design to build intricate software systems. It enables developers to connect the relevant software components to form a system that continuously adapts to evolving requirements. This approach is guided by three key principles:</p>
<ul class="points">

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">21) What do you understand by OAuth?</h3>
<p>OAuth is a widely used protocol for accessing client applications on HTTP through third-party providers like Facebook and GitHub. It enables the sharing of resources across different sites without the need for their credentials.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">22) What is Spring Boot? Why is it used?</h3>
<p>Spring Boot is a Java-based framework which enables developers to create efficient stand-alone applications quickly and easily. Its open-source nature adds to its appeal, allowing developers to benefit from its extensive resources. One of its key advantages is the automatic configuration of claims when dependencies are added to an application, reducing time and improving productivity. Overall, Spring Boot is a straightforward and user-friendly option for building high-quality applications.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">23) What is the method to override a Spring Boot project's default properties?</h3>
<p>To specify the suffix and prefix for Spring MVC applications, it's necessary to provide the required properties in the application.properties file. These properties are essential for proper functioning of the application. By setting the desired suffix and prefix, the application will be able to handle requests more efficiently and deliver the intended results.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>For suffix:</strong>mvc.view.suffix: .jsp</li>

<hr>
<h3 class="h3">24) What do you understand by end-to-end Microservices testing?</h3>
<p>End-to-end testing is a crucial process that examines the entire workflow to confirm that every step is working properly. It's also used to verify that all system components work seamlessly together and meet all specified requirements.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">25) What is the difference between Coupling and Cohesion? </h3>
<p><strong>Coupling and cohesion are two important concepts in software engineering that are often used interchangeably, but they actually have different meanings. Both concepts are related to the quality of a software system's design, but while coupling refers to how two or more components are connected to each other, cohesion refers to how well the elements within a single component work together. It's important for software developers to understand the difference between these two concepts to be able to design and develop better software systems.</strong></p>
<p>The term "coupling" refers to the connection between module A and another module B. There are three types of coupling: high, loose, and none. Highly coupled modules are heavily reliant on each other, whereas loosely coupled modules have less dependence. The most desirable type of coupling is loose, which is achieved through interfaces.</p>
<p>In software design, cohesion refers to the extent to which the elements within a module are related to one another and work together effectively. When a module has high cohesion, it means that its constituent parts are closely connected and able to perform a specific task independently. Modules with high cohesion are more efficient and effective at performing their designated function. This is because they do not rely heavily on communication with other modules to complete their tasks. As a result, high cohesion is a desirable characteristic in software design because it increases the functional strength of the module.</p>
